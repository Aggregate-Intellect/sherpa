Evaluation of Multimodal RAG Systems using the LlamaIndex 
=========================================================
*Val Andrei Fajardo* 

Summary 
-------
The speaker discusses the evaluation of multimodal RAG systems using the LlamaIndex library. They explain the concept of retrieval augmented generation (rag) systems and how the LlamaIndex library serves as a data orchestration framework. The evaluation of RAG systems is split into retrieval and generation components, with metrics like hit rate and mean reciprocal rank for retrieval evaluation, and metrics like correctness, faithfulness, and relevancy for generation evaluation. The speaker demonstrates building a multimodal rag system for spelling in American Sign Language (ASL) and presents evaluation results. They also address questions about the LlamaIndex, measurement of correctness, faithfulness, and relevance, and introduce the Llama Hub portal. The speaker discusses challenges in evaluating language models and highlights the importance of open-source alternatives and multimodal research.
