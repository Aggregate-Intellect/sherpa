The Business Impact and Challenges of Using Large Language Models 
=================================================================
*Suhas Pai* 

Summary 
-------
There is constant pressure from peers and upper management to tap into the novel capabilities provided by LLMs. But are the capabilities provided by LLMs always aligned with your business values? In this talk, I will showcase how 'Large' LMs may not always be the best task to solve your problem, and provide pointers on how to effectively divide your tasks such that each task is performed by the model/algorithm that is best suited for it. I will provide real-life examples and argue the effectiveness of having several models of different sizes working in tandem as opposed to pinning all hopes on the largest model available.

Suhas Pai shares his experience and insights on the business impact of using large language models (LLMs) and the challenges involved in taking prototypes to production. He discusses the impact of LLMs in the business world, the trade-offs in text summarization, challenges in the finance industry, and addresses audience questions. He emphasizes the need for careful consideration of how LLMs can add value to a company's products and services.
