Summary 
-------
Victoria Firsanova discusses her major project for her doctoral work, which focuses on building a mobile app for the inclusion of people with autism spectrum disorder. She discusses the creation of a question answering system, the use of extractive approaches, the challenges of generative models, and the development of a reliable graph question answering system. She also showcases a prototype of her app and discusses future directions. 

Topics: 
-------
	Building a mobile app for the inclusion of individuals with autism spectrum disorder 
		* The project stemmed from personal experiences 
		* A question answering system was created to provide information on autism spectrum disorder 
		* A dataset was created for training the system 
		* Consultation with a psychiatrist and crowdsourcing were utilized 
		* The goal is to create a system that can answer questions related to autism spectrum disorder, inclusion, and education 
	Utilizing large language models and machine learning techniques 
		* An extractive approach is employed to extract answers from passages 
		* Models like BERT are used to encode passages and identify answers 
		* A two-fold extractive approach involving a search engine can also be used 
		* Generative models like GPT-2 were explored but have limitations 
		* Models that prioritize the needs of minorities and individuals with limited capabilities are needed 
	Creating a reliable graph question answering system 
		* Structured information from a knowledge base called Dbpd is accessed 
		* Sparkle queries are used to retrieve precise information 
		* Transformer encoder models and generative models like Dpt family are explored 
		* A prototype of the app includes features such as a conversational AI agent, a planner calendar, social stories, a diary for parents, and an inclusive social media platform 
	Future directions 
		* Exploring the React framework 
		* Fine-tuning language models for specific disorders or domains
