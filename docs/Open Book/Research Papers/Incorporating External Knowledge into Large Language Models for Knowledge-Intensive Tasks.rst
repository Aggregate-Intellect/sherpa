Summary 
-------
The presentation discusses the importance of incorporating external knowledge into language models for knowledge-intensive tasks. It explores fusion methods, knowledge sources, and challenges in the field. The limitations of language models in handling uncertainties and reasoning are also addressed. 

Topics: 
-------
	Importance of External Knowledge 
		* External knowledge is crucial for improving the performance of language models in knowledge-intensive tasks. 
		* Retrieving external knowledge can be challenging, and designing effective retrieval systems is important. 
		* Certain knowledge sources need to be transformed into natural language format before incorporating them into training data. 
	Fusion Methods 
		* Fusion methods can be categorized as pre-fusion, post-fusion, or hybrid approaches. 
		* Pre-fusion methods involve training the language model with combined data of knowledge sources and training texts. 
		* Post-fusion methods fuse knowledge at the fine-tuning stage. 
		* Hybrid methods combine pre-fusion and post-fusion approaches to better leverage retrieved knowledge. 
	Different Fusion Techniques 
		* Two common fusion techniques are Technique A and Technique B. 
		* Technique A involves using another encoder to convert knowledge into embeddings and combining them with the language model's embeddings. 
		* Technique B, known as prompt engineering, concatenates the knowledge with the input text and feeds it to the language model. 
		* Prompt engineering is a widely used and intuitive technique. 
	Advantages and Shortcomings 
		* The choice of fusion method depends on the type of task. 
		* For factual knowledge-intensive tasks, post-fusion methods are preferred. 
		* For tasks involving common sense knowledge, pre-fusion methods are more suitable. 
		* Post-fusion methods allow for the use of explicit and concrete knowledge, while pre-fusion methods cover implicit common sense knowledge. 
	Challenges and Future Directions 
		* There is a need for unified large-enhanced models that can handle diverse domains. 
		* The reliability of knowledge sources created through automatic acquisition algorithms is a concern. 
		* Further research is needed to understand the inner workings of reasoning modules in large-enhanced models. 
		* Transparency and expandability of reasoning modules are important considerations. 
	Discussion on Language Models and Reasoning 
		* Language models have limitations in handling uncertainties and reasoning. 
		* Bayesian belief networks or reinforcement learning can be used to improve reasoning approaches. 
		* Designing systems that can prompt users for specific information is important. 
		* Consideration of known unknown and unknown unknown information is crucial. 
	Conclusion 
		* Incorporating external knowledge into language models is important for knowledge-intensive tasks. 
		* Different fusion methods and techniques have advantages and shortcomings. 
		* Handling uncertainties and reasoning in language models requires further research. 
		* Large language models have the potential to solve complex problems.
