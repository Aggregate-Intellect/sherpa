The Use of LLMs for Security Compliance Assessment 
==================================================
*Ayesha Hafeez* 

Summary 
-------
In this talk, we will delve into the innovative approach of automating security compliance assessment using Large Language Models (LLMs). By comparing organizational policies against a set of standard controls, we were able to streamline the assessment process. Throughout the session, we will provide insights into the complete ML process, covering key aspects such as ML problem framing, dataset curation, LLM selection, evaluation, and integration with the overall solution.

Ayesha Hafeez, the director of ML Solutions and Architecture at Arctic AI, discusses the use of LLMs (Language Model Models) for security compliance assessment. She explains the problem of manual compliance assessment and the benefits of automation using LLMs. Ayesha also provides an overview of the machine learning pipeline and the functional components involved in the solution.
