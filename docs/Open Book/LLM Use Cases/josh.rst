================================================
*Speaker* 

Summary 
-------
LLMs have been rapidly adopted by the market research industry, with cascading impacts for both B2B and B2C businesses. In this case study, we look at a survey conducted to understand Canadians' opinions of federal party leaders, and show how conversations driven by LLMs lead to more considered responses and ultimately more actionable insights.

Josh discusses the impact of language models on market research, including data collection, analysis, and the potential for AI transformation in the industry. He highlights the benefits of combining qualitative and quantitative research methods and provide a case study on the use of language models in analyzing political associations. The speaker also discusses the challenges and limitations of using language models in market research.

Topics: 
-------
Data Collection in Market Research 
	* Market research traditionally employs qualitative and quantitative approaches. 
	* Qualitative research involves methods like focus groups and interviews, while quantitative research is conducted through surveys. 
	* Language models enable automated conversations at scale. 
	* Conversational agents like Inca facilitate rich and semi-structured data collection. 
Analysis in Market Research 
	* Language models are being leveraged at all stages of the research lifecycle, including hypothesis generation, idea generation, knowledge management, and content creation. 
	* Language models enable researchers to ask questions about their data and explore it in new ways. 
	* Probing with language models can provide more detailed and valuable insights in market research analysis. 
Case Study: Political Associations 
	* Language models were used to analyze people's associations with political leaders. 
	* Probing with language models doubled the number of significant differences in associations. 
	* Probing provided richer insights into the specific policies that people associate with different leaders. 
Challenges and Limitations of Language Models in Market Research 
	* There are concerns about survey fraudsters using language models to generate fake survey responses. 
	* The adoption of AI in market research has been slow due to the lack of quality insights generated by AI tools. 
	* There is an emerging debate on the use of synthetic data in market research, with concerns about bias and the need for further research. 
	* Despite challenges, embracing AI technologies in market research can lead to significant financial gains.
