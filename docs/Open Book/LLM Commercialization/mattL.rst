Matt discusses the role of augmented intelligence (AI) in the field of life sciences, emphasizing the synergy between AI and humans. He also highlights the potential of augmented intelligence in transforming life sciences and the importance of collaboration between humans and AI. Matt also discusses the challenges of implementing change and innovation in organizations. 

Topics: 
-------
Definition of Augmented Intelligence 
	* Augmented intelligence is the intentional design of software by humans to enhance cognitive performance and decision-making. 
	* AI and human collaboration can significantly reduce error rates and improve effectiveness in various areas of life sciences and healthcare. 
Transforming Life Sciences with Augmented Intelligence 
	* Augmented intelligence has the potential to revolutionize insight generation, content generation, strategic decision-making, and customer interactions in life sciences. 
	* Major professional societies encourage viewing AI as a tool to enhance work rather than a threat to jobs. 
Challenges of Implementing Change and Innovation 
	* Implementing change and innovation requires a comprehensive understanding of the stages of change, adoption curve, organizational resistance, post-implementation challenges, regulatory frameworks, critical mass adoption, and the importance of trust. 
	* Change requires more than just champions advocating for it.
