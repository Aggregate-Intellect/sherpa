Large Language Models: To Build or To Buy? 
==========================================
*Abi Aryan* 

Summary 
-------
When deploying machine learning models in production, there are three properties that are commonly desired: generalization, evaluation, and cost-optimality. We conjecture that for machine learning models, it is impossible to optimize all three. I will talk about our framework for cost modeling and evaluation for large language models (LLMs) and present our LLMOps production pipeline.

Abi Aryan, a machine learning engineer, discusses the decision-making process of whether to build or buy large language models (LLMs). He emphasizes the importance of aligning business use cases with model performance metrics and considering factors like generalizability, evaluability, and cost optimality.

Introduction 
	* Abi Aryan is a machine learning engineer with experience in deploying ML models in production. 
	* He has worked on a startup focused on building orchestration tools for agent-based models. 
	* He has written a book for O'Reilly on large language models and their limitations. 
	* He provides consulting services to a VC fund, offering insights on investments in the LLM space. 
Build or Buy Decision 
	* The decision to build or buy LLMs depends on factors such as project stage and revenue generation goals. 
	* During the experimentation phase, the focus is on exploring the capabilities of the models. 
	* When building a product, revenue generation becomes crucial. 
	* Tying business key performance indicators (KPIs) with performance metrics is important to demonstrate the value of LLMs. 
Business Use Case Clarity 
	* Clear use cases like podcast summarization and copyrighting tools are important when integrating LLMs. 
	* Determining if LLMs can generate revenue sustainably is essential. 
	* There are potential applications beyond the mentioned use cases. 
Pillars for Success 
	* The three pillars for success when integrating LLMs are generalizability, evaluability, and cost optimality. 
	* Achieving all three simultaneously is challenging and often involves trade-offs. 
Costs Associated with LLMs 
	* Significant investment in human evaluators is required for model evaluation. 
	* The GEC framework focuses on generalization, evaluability, and cost optimization as the main use cases for LLMs. 
Model Selection Checklist 
	* Consider factors such as open source or proprietary models, number of parameters, training data availability, inference cost, and size of the context window when selecting a model. 
	* Reliability and long-term support for models should also be considered. 
Q&A Session 
	* Aryan addresses questions about model deprecation, prompt engineering versus fine-tuning costs, and the advantages of shorter context windows. 
	* Careful evaluation and benchmarking of LLMs is emphasized. 
Conclusion 
	* The decision-making process of building or buying LLMs and the associated costs are emphasized. 
	* Aligning business use cases with model performance metrics is important. 
	* Factors like generalizability, evaluability, and cost optimality should be carefully evaluated. 
	* Informed decisions can be made to build reliable products using LLMs.
