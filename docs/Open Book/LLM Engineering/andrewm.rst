Language Model Operations (LLM-Ops) 
===================================
*Andrew McMahon* 

Summary 
-------
The explosion of interest in LLMs over the past year has meant that more organizations and teams are questioning what it will take to run solutions using these models in production. In this talk, Andy will bring some of his thoughts and ideas around what the new marriage between MLOps and LLMs (LLMOps) means and where the challenges lie. This talk is useful for data scientists, ML and MLOps engineers as well as business stakeholders who want to get an idea of where this new field is and where it is going.
