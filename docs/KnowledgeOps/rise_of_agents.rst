Rise of Autonomous Information Seeking Companions
=================================================

We continue observing a rapid movement towards creation of agents that
can *reason* about the objectives they are given, *use tools* to carry
out related tasks using formal languages, and use *natural anguage
skills* to communicate with their operators. This trend might (and most
probably will) lead into *thinking companions* that can interact with
us, seek information and insight on our behald, and synthesize artifacts
towards objectives we have. The ease of interaction with these
companions could (and most probably will) get to a point where we can
learn / plan / build on our own terms as we commute / run / cook.

**SUMMARY**

1.  KnowledgeOps is the next stage where automation is created using
    information seeking agents.
2.  Knowledge jobs involve managing an organizationâ€™s knowledge assets
    and processes to increase efficiency and effectiveness of
    information intensive tasks.
3.  Information intensive tasks include learning about LLMs and other
    topics that require consulting different resources and finding
    information.
4.  An agent like Sherpa could assist with learning by finding and
    presenting relevant information to the user.
5.  In the future, it may be possible to interact with such agents using
    voice commands while engaging in physical activities like jogging.
6.  An agent called Sherpa could assist with finding and presenting
    relevant information to the user.
7.  Knowledge assets include data, code, tools, and documentation, while
    processes include communication, collaboration, and project
    management.
8.  Agents like Sherpa could help with collaboration, communication, and
    project management.
9.  MLOps is a new concept that automates experimentation, data, and
    model handling.
10. MLOps is a step forward from DevOps in terms of automating manual
    processes.
11. KnowledgeOps is a new concept that automates exploration, planning,
    and coding of ideas.
12. Continuous exploration (CE) is a key component of KnowledgeOps,
    where ideas are explored, built, integrated, delivered, measured,
    and repeated.
13. Industry trends suggest a shift towards merging of specialized
    semantic search, recommendation, and other tools with generative
    co-pilots.
14. In order to have an effective agent for information-intensive tasks,
    three types of skills are necessary: reasoning, content
    understanding, and execution.
15. Large language models can provide these skills for an agent.
16. The AI agent can prioritize tasks, execute them using different
    tools, keep track of them in memory, and reflect on its observations
    and achievements.
17. Similar ideas are being developed by other companies and projects,
    such as AutoGPT, BabyAGI, and Microsoft Jarvis.
18. Reflection is a step in the process of using large language models
    to prompt the system for information, reasoning, and criticism to
    suggest a resolution.
19. These agents can call smaller or large language models or other ml
    models for regression or mathematical calculations.
20. An engaged community and tools like this can be powerful in allowing
    people to try out their ideas quickly.
21. MLOps and DevOps allowed us to move fast and break things, and now
    it is KnowledgeOps turn to empower trying out ideas cheaply.
22. KnowledgeOpd can involve creating systems, processes, and
    collaboration tools that make it easy for anyone to try out ideas.
23. The process of using large language models can generate
    implementation-ready code, but it is ultimately up to the operator
    to ensure its accuracy and feasibility.
24. The power of this approach is in democratizing entrepreneurship and
    making it accessible to more people, regardless of their financial
    or social status.
25. Ethical questions need to be asked and discussed regarding the
    control and sharing of data and intellectual property.
26. For example large language models can be used to generate
    implementation plans and steps for a project, taking into account
    available information and time estimates.
27. Auto-generated documents can be sent to clients or users, providing
    a starting point for further discussion and exploration of ideas.
28. TThese agents dynamically construct prompts that control the
    behavior of the AI agent, allowing for more efficient and effective
    use of the system.
29. The system can access both internal and external knowledge
    resources, synthesizing information from multiple sources to
    complete tasks.
30. Prompt engineering may become obsolete as more tools allow for
    dynamic prompt construction.
31. Evaluating and reflecting on past actions is important for refining
    and improving the approach to future tasks.
32. Access to specialized tools and resources, such as the Notion API,
    can be integrated into the system to further streamline processes.
33. The AI agent can be used for a variety of applications, such as
    teaching assistants or project management tools.
34. The process of brainstorming with Sharepa and generating an action
    plan is iterative and can be refined based on new information or
    feedback.
35. Collaboration and communication with the AI agent is important to
    ensure the action plan is tailored to specific needs and
    constraints.
36. The AI agent can scrape information from external sources and
    incorporate it into the action plan, improving its accuracy and
    effectiveness.
