DevOps -> MLOps -> KnowledgeOps
===============================

DevOps and ModelOps have transformed software development over the past
two decades, but now we are seeing a further shift left with the rise of
KnowledgeOps. This new era leverages tools to augment our
problem-solving, planning, and critical thinking abilities, enabling us
to tackle highly complex knowledge work with greater efficiency and
effectiveness. KnowledgeOps promises to enhance our ability to
experiment with a wider range of ideas and select the most impactful
ones, similar to the benefits seen in DevOps and related methodologies.

**TWITTER THREAD SUMMARY OF THE TALK:**

-  KnowledgeOps and Development Processes

   -  1/14: #KnowledgeOps is about managing an organization’s or
      community’s knowledge assets and processes to enable reuse and
      collaboration. #DevOps and #ModelOps (#MLOps) are specific
      examples that help develop software faster and with lower chances
      of failure.
   -  2/14: #ShiftingLeft and #CI/CD are important #DevOps concepts that
      bring testing and quality assurance to the beginning of the
      software development process and provide tools to automate them
      for consistency and repeatability.
   -  3/14: Although automation has improved many parts of the
      development process, the step of discovering and planning is still
      largely manual, requiring continuous communication and
      collaboration with teammates, which creates a single point of
      failure.
   -  4/14: #ModelOps (e.g., #MLOps) has allowed for the automation of
      data and model handling, but the manual interpretation and
      decision-making steps are still present. #Automation

-  Generative AI, and Continuous Exploration / Continuous Integration /
   Continuous Delivery

   -  5/14: Generative AI can help us shift further left into the
      exploration, planning, and coding steps, significantly improving
      our ability to explore options and conduct experiments.
      #GenerativeAI #SoftwareDevelopment
   -  6/14: There will eventually be more automation in our
      problem-solving processes, but in the meantime, tools built with
      generative AI will significantly augment our ability for
      interpretation and decision-making in ensuring the success of the
      development of complex software systems. #MachineLearning #AI
   -  7/14: Emerging tools for thinking allow for a more experimental
      approach to knowledge-intensive work, allowing for continuous
      hypothesis generation and experimentation leading to CE/CI/CD.
      #ContinuousExploration #ContinuousIntegration #ContinuousDelivery
   -  8/14: There is a trend towards interfacing generative copilots,
      retrieval systems, and other knowledge-intensive systems to create
      thinking machines with memory and reasoning skills. #GenerativeAI
      #RetrievalSystems #Reasoning
   -  9/14: Language models are essential for these tools because they
      need to interpret users’ instructions usually provided in natural
      language, communicate results, and facilitate human-human
      communication. #LanguageModels #Communication
   -  10/14: Language models can give us the ability to articulate and
      communicate complex ideas effectively to stakeholders and team
      members enabling more efficient problem solving in communities and
      organizations. #LanguageModels #Communication

-  Adoption of Knowledge-Ops

   -  11/14: In bigger companies, beyond technology, the biggest
      barriers to implementing #KnowledgeOps are cultural problems; eg.
      political reasons that prevent a unified and integrated knowledge
      and expertise system connected to knowledge bases of all teams
      across the enterprise. #CulturalProblems
   -  12/14: Since all #GPT can reliably provide in short term is the
      language skill, primarily NLU/NLG, smaller language models trained
      on internal knowledge can be built to avoid privacy and data
      access issues. #NaturalLanguageUnderstanding
      #NaturalLanguageGeneration
   -  13/14: Adoption of #LLM enabled thinking tools will start in
      smaller companies, and with improvements in corporate culture and
      maturing technology, we will see bigger companies joining the
      movement.
   -  14/14: With these tools being able to talk to us, remember our
      context, and reason about the world around us without the barriers
      of coding and formal language, we can accelerate #KnowledgeOps to
      the point where no idea is too expensive to try. #Automation
