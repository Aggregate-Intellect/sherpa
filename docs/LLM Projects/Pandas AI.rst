Summary 
-------
The presentation focused on the challenges and advancements in using large-language models for tasks such as natural language to pandas code conversion. It also discussed the capabilities of large-language models in machine learning research, including data analysis, data visualization, and data exploration. The presentation highlighted the potential of large-language models in democratizing access to data analytics and showcased the capabilities of Pandas-Ai, a platform that focuses on data analysis and conversation with data. 

Topics: 
-------
	Pandas-Ai: Democratizing Access to Data Analytics 
		* Pandas-Ai is a platform that focuses on data analysis and conversation with data 
		* The goal of Pandas-Ai is to democratize access to data analytics and make it accessible to non-technical users 
		* Pandas-Ai uses a step-by-step process to maximize output within minimum time 
		* Pandas-Ai obtains metadata from data frames and passes it along with synthesized samples of the records 
		* Pandas-Ai generates Python code using a large language model and whitelists several libraries related to data analysis for safety 
		* Pandas-Ai can execute the generated code and provide output in various formats 
	Integration of Large-Language Models with Other Tools 
		* Large-language models can be integrated with other tools for data visualization and exploration 
		* Models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have good coverage and access to a vast amount of data 
		* Shortcuts are available for common tasks, reducing the need for specific prompts 
		* Large-language models offer functions for finance, customer segmentation, and other tasks 
	Applications of Large-Language Models in Machine Learning Research 
		* Large-language models can be used for time series analysis, forecasting, and conversational interfaces 
		* Large-language models can analyze and predict sales data 
		* Streamlit can be used to create conversational user interfaces 
		* Semantic cache can improve query response time 
		* The system architecture includes a vector database and entity recognition for relevant information 
		* The system uses a combination of a vector database and entity recognition to provide accurate responses 
		* The system is still in development and aims to provide accurate and relevant responses to user queries 
	Challenges and Advancements in Large-Language Models 
		* Handling overlapping datasets and poorly structured tables pose challenges 
		* Context helps determine the structure of queries and relevant columns 
		* Coverage is generally well-covered with models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 
		* Combining small, use case-specific models with large-language models can improve efficiency 
		* The system is not sensitive to the size of the data 
		* Fine-tuning the adaptation layer and using quantized models can improve results 
		* The system has a retry mechanism to handle errors within the generated code 
	Privacy and Future Developments 
		* The system aims to rely on synthetic data to enhance privacy 
		* The system currently sends some representation of the data to providers like OpenAI 
		* The future architecture may include data catalog features and improvements in handling errors 
		* Synaptic, a company involved in revolutionizing data handling, was briefly mentioned 
		* The library being developed is intended for both technical and non-technical users
