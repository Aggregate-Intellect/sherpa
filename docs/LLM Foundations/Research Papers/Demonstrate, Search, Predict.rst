Summary 
-------
The presentation focused on the use of the DSP (Demonstrate, Search, Predict) framework and its application in language models for knowledge-intensive tasks. Amini explained that the main idea behind DSP is to address the issue of hallucinations in language models by incorporating reasoning capabilities. 

Topics: 
-------
	DSP Framework 
		* DSP framework addresses the issue of hallucinations in language models by incorporating reasoning capabilities. 
		* The DSP framework consists of three steps: demonstrate, search, and predict. 
		* DSP allows language models to perform multi-hop reasoning and arrive at the correct answer. 
		* DSP provides flexibility and can be customized to suit different needs. 
	Coding Exercise 
		* Different strategies were explored in the coding exercise to improve the performance of language models. 
		* The exercise involved five programs, each representing a different strategy. 
		* The models' performance was evaluated using a set of training questions and tested on development questions. 
	GPT 2.5 and GPT 3 Models 
		* GPT 2.5 and GPT 3 models are used to answer questions and improve the accuracy of the answers. 
		* Answers are generated by retrieving relevant passages and generating completions based on those passages. 
		* Self-consistency in the answers is important to ensure accuracy. 
	Multi-hop Question Answering 
		* Multi-hop question answering is an approach that improves the accuracy of answers by searching for missing information and updating the context. 
		* Multiple search queries using PSP are added to enhance the accuracy of answers. 
	Applications and Future Possibilities 
		* DSP is not limited to multi-hop question answering and can be applied to conversational questions and various types of data and models. 
		* Large-language models can be used in controlling robots and learning through experimentation and feedback. 
		* Additional modules can be added to expand the capabilities of the system.
