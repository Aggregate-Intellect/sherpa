Sherpa: AI-Augmented Thinking Companion
=======================================

Overview
^^^^^^^^

Welcome to the `Sherpa <https://github.com/Aggregate-Intellect/sherpa>`__ documentation.

**Sherpa's purpose is to make building solutions with Large Language Models (LLMs) easier for founders, developers, and operators.**
We are particularly interested in augmenting and automating complex business workflows
with multi-agent systems.

The ultimate **vision** for Sherpa is to be a configurable and versatile Python library for managing multi-agent LLM systems.

See :doc:`About Sherpa<About_Sherpa/index>` for background on the project
inspiration and philosophy.
