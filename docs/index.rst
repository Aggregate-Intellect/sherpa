SHERPA: AI-AUGMENTED THINKING COMPANION
========================================

Project Overview:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Project's Purpose: this project aims to leverage large language models (mainly multi agent systems) to make building with LLMs easier for founders, developers, and operators. The project aims to gather, summarize, and index various high quality resources (both technical and business) and also provide a companion slack app for easier interaction with this information.  
- Goals: Create a hivemind for building businesses with llms (and other tech)
- Target audience: LLM founders, developers, and operators
- Vision: This repo to be an authoritive source of information for those who want to leverage generative AI in their work and build regardless of how small or big their projects are.
- Mission: Create an ecosystem of experts, ideas, tools, and a community that build together until we get to a point where no idea is too expensive to try.
