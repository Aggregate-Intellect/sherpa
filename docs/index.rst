This book contains notes, videos, slides, and resources from the workshops and journal club sessions run by `Aggregate Intellect <https://ai.science>`__ to update and educate our community about the explosive progress in language models (and generally generative models). Our vision for this repo is to be an authoritive source of information for those who want to leverage generative AI in their work and build regardless of how small or big their projects are.

Our mission is to create an ecosystem of experts, ideas, tools, and a community that build together until we get to a point where no idea is too expensive to try.
