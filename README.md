## Making Changes through Pull Requests

To make changes to this project, you will need to fork the repository to your own GitHub account, make the changes to your forked repository, and then submit a pull request to our main repository. Here are the steps:

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button on the top right of the repository page.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git`
3. Create a new branch for your changes by running the following command: `git checkout -b your-branch-name`
4. Make the desired changes to the book.
5. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message by running the following command:`git commit -m "your commit message"`
6. Push your changes to your forked repository by running the following command: `git push origin your-branch-name`
7. Go to the main repository and submit a pull request with a description of your changes.

Once your pull request is submitted, it will be reviewed by our team and either merged or commented on for further changes.

NOTE: If the change you are considering is fairly major, please suggest it as an issue first so that we can coordinate before you put in the effort.

## Suggesting Changes through Issues

If you would like to suggest changes to the book without making direct changes, you can create an issue in our repository. Here are the steps:

1. Go to the repository and click on the "Issues" tab.
2. Click on the "New Issue" button.
3. Provide a descriptive title and description of your suggested change.
4. Optionally, you can label your issue to make it easier to categorize.
5. Submit the issue.

Our team will review the issue and either implement the suggested change or respond with feedback.
