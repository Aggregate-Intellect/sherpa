# PRACTICAL LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMs): AN OPEN BOOK PROJECT - INTRODUCTION

[<img src="docs/cover_image.png">](https://llm-live-book.readthedocs.io/)

**To see the book, visit: https://llm-live-book.readthedocs.io/**

This repo contains material and information from the workshops and journal club sessions run by [Aggregate Intellect](https://ai.science) to update and educate our community about the explosive progress in language models (and generally generative models). Our vision for this repo is to be an authoritive source of information for those who want to leverage generative AI in their work and build regardless of how small or big their projects are.

Our _mission_ is to create an ecosystem of experts, ideas, tools, and a community that build together until we get to a point where **no idea is too expensive to try**.

## What does "An Open Book Project" mean?

We will continue adding material to this repository, but feel free to add any questions or suggestions through pull requests or through reporting issues.

Given the rapid pace of development in LLM space, we are releasing this information as an open book project which means that we welcome and encourage contributions from anyone who is interested and esp anyone who has used LLMs in production setting and wants to share their learnings with the broader community. See the bottom of this page for step by step instructions for how you can contribute.
