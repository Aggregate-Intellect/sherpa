### From source (with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aggregate-Intellect/sherpa
cd sherpa/src
poetry install
```

Some dependencies such as `chromadb` or `sentence-transformers` are optional and only required to run some specific functionalities (such as the DocumentSearch action). These dependencies are not install by default. You can either install them separated as needed, all install the entire suite using the `--with` flag from `poetry`:
```bash
poetry install --with optional
```
Similarly, you can install dependencies for testing and linting:
```bash
poetry install --with optional,test,lint
```

### From source (with pip editable mode):
```bash
git clone
cd sherpa/src
pip install -e .
```
