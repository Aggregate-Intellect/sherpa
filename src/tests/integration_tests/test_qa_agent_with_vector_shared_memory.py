The Eiffel Tower can be 15 cm taller during the summer, due to thermal expansion meaning the iron heats up, the particles gain kinetic energy and take up more space.
Trypophobia is the fear of closely-packed holes. Or more specifically, "an aversion to the sight of irregular patterns or clusters of small holes or bumps." No crumpets for them, then.
Allodoxaphobia is the fear of other people's opinions. It's a rare social phobia that's characterised by an irrational and overwhelming fear of what other people think.

Emma Bunton auditioned for the role of Bianca Butcher in Eastenders. Baby Spice already had a small part in the soap back in the 90s but tried out for a full-time role. She was pipped to the post by Patsy Palmer but ended up auditioning for the Spice Girls not long after.
Human teeth are the only part of the body that cannot heal themselves. Teeth are coated in enamel which is not a living tissue.
It's illegal to own just one guinea pig in Switzerland. It's considered animal abuse because they're social beings and get lonely.
The Ancient Romans used to drop a piece of toast into their wine for good health - hence why we 'raise a toast'.
The heart of a shrimp is located in its head. They also have an open circulatory system, which means they have no arteries and their organs float directly in blood.
Amy Poehler was only seven years older than Rachel McAdams when she took on the role of "cool mom" in Mean Girls. Rachel was 25 as Regina George - Amy was 32 as her mum.

Venus is the only planet to spin clockwise. It travels around the sun once every 225 Earth days but it rotates clockwise once every 243 days.
Nutmeg is a hallucinogen. The spice contains myristicin, a natural compound that has mind-altering effects if ingested in large doses.
A 73-year-old bottle of French Burgundy became the most expensive bottle of wine ever sold at auction in 2018, going for $558,000 (approx £439,300). The bottle of 1945 Romanee-Conti sold at Sotheby for more than 17 times its original estimate of $32,000."""
