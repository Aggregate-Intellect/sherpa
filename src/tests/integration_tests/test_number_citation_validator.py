        #         Sabio delivered revenues of US$8.0M in Q2-2023, up 11% from US$7.2M in Q2-2022.
        #         CTV/OTT sales as a category increased by 57% to US$5.0 million, compared to US$3.2 million in the prior year's quarter. CTV/OTT sales accounted for 62% of the Company's sales mix, compared with 44% in the prior year's quarter.
        #         Mobile display revenues of US$2.9million in Q2-2023, down 24%, from US$3.9 million in Q2-2022, as our legacy mobile display campaigns continued to shift their spend with Sabio from mobile display to higher-margin mobile OTT streaming, which is recognized under the Company's CTV/OTT revenue category.
        #         Gross Profit of US$4.8 million in Q2-2023, up from US$4.3 million in Q2-2022. Gross Margin improved on a year-over-year basis, from 59% in Q2-2022 to 60% in the completed quarter. The increase is attributable to several efficiency and direct sales improvements within the CTV/OTT channel as well as our App Science business.
        #         Adjusted EBITDA1 loss of US$1.7 million in Q2-2023 compared to a loss of US$1.4 million in Q2-2022. The loss was primarily driven by overhead added during and subsequent to the second quarter of 2022, which included the continued expansion of our sales and marketing apparatus in the prior year and costs associated with transitioning our workforce back to the office. On a sequential basis, second quarter operating expenses, normalized for commissions, were flat in comparison to the first quarter of 2023 as cost efficiencies implemented by management offset incremental headcount additions to our salesforce to position ourselves for the 2024 U.S. elections.
        #         As of June 30, 2023, the Company had cash of US$1.7 million, as compared to US$2.4 million on June 30, 2022.`

                Soccer, also known as association football, is a sport played between two teams of 33 players on a rectangular field. The goal is to score more goals than the other team by kicking or heading the ball into the opponent's goal. Players can't use their hands or arms, except for the goalie, to touch the ball. Instead, they can use their legs, head, and torso to pass the ball. Soccer is the world's most popular sport, with 250 million players in over 200 countries.
