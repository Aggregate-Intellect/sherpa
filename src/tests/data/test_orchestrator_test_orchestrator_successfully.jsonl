Specifically, focus on algorithms that have been successfully used for similar tasks in the past and have proven accuracy and reliability.\\n\\nRelevant Paper Title and Summary:\\nTitle: Tropical cyclone intensity estimations over the Indian ocean using\\n  Machine Learning\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclones are one of the most powerful and destructive natural\\nphenomena on earth. Tropical storms and heavy rains can cause floods, which\\nlead to human lives and economic loss. Devastating winds accompanying cyclones\\nheavily affect not only the coastal regions, even distant areas. Our study\\nfocuses on the intensity estimation, particularly cyclone grade and maximum\\nsustained surface wind speed (MSWS) of a tropical cyclone over the North Indian\\nOcean. We use various machine learning algorithms to estimate cyclone grade and\\nMSWS. We have used the basin of origin, date, time, latitude, longitude,\\nestimated central pressure, and pressure drop as attributes of our models. We\\nuse multi-class classification models for the categorical outcome variable,\\ncyclone grade, and regression models for MSWS as it is a continuous variable.\\nUsing the best track data of 28 years over the North Indian Ocean, we estimate\\ngrade with an accuracy of 88% and MSWS with a root mean square error (RMSE) of\\n2.3. For higher grade categories (5-7), accuracy improves to an average of\\n98.84%. We tested our model with two recent tropical cyclones in the North\\nIndian Ocean, Vayu and Fani. For grade, we obtained an accuracy of 93.22% and\\n95.23% respectively, while for MSWS, we obtained RMSE of 2.2 and 3.4 and $R^2$\\nof 0.99 and 0.99, respectively.\\n Title: TCR-GAN: Predicting tropical cyclone passive microwave rainfall using\\n  infrared imagery via generative adversarial networks\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclones (TC) generally carry large amounts of water vapor and can\\ncause large-scale extreme rainfall. Passive microwave rainfall (PMR) estimation\\nof TC with high spatial and temporal resolution is crucial for disaster warning\\nof TC, but remains a challenging problem due to the low temporal resolution of\\nmicrowave sensors. This study attempts to solve this problem by directly\\nforecasting PMR from satellite infrared (IR) images of TC. We develop a\\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) to convert IR images into PMR, and\\nestablish the mapping relationship between TC cloud-top bright temperature and\\nPMR, the algorithm is named TCR-GAN. Meanwhile, a new dataset that is available\\nas a benchmark, Dataset of Tropical Cyclone IR-to-Rainfall Prediction (TCIRRP)\\nwas established, which is expected to advance the development of artificial\\nintelligence in this direction. Experimental results show that the algorithm\\ncan effectively extract key features from IR. The end-to-end deep learning\\napproach shows potential as a technique that can be applied globally and\\nprovides a new perspective tropical cyclone precipitation prediction via\\nsatellite, which is expected to provide important insights for real-time\\nvisualization of TC rainfall globally in operations.\\n Title: WRF model parameter calibration to improve the prediction of tropical\\n  cyclones over the Bay of Bengal using Machine Learning-based Multiobjective\\n  Optimization\\nSummary:   The prediction skill of a numerical model can be enhanced by calibrating the\\nsensitive parameters that significantly influence the model forecast. The\\nobjective of the present study is to improve the prediction of surface wind\\nspeed and precipitation by calibrating the Weather Research and Forecasting\\n(WRF) model parameters for the simulations of tropical cyclones over the Bay of\\nBengal region. Ten tropical cyclones across different intensity categories\\nbetween 2011 and 2017 are selected for the calibration experiments. Eight\\nsensitive model parameters are calibrated by minimizing the prediction error\\ncorresponding to 10m wind speed and precipitation, using a multiobjective\\nadaptive surrogate model-based optimization (MO-ASMO) framework. The 10m wind\\nspeed and precipitation simulated by the default and calibrated parameter\\nvalues across different aspects are compared. The results show that the\\ncalibrated parameters improved the prediction of 10m wind speed by 17.62% and\\nprecipitation by 8.20% compared to the default parameters. The effect of\\ncalibrated parameters on other model output variables, such as cyclone track\\nand intensities, and 500 hPa wind fields, is investigated. Eight tropical\\ncyclones across different categories between 2011 and 2018 are selected to\\ncorroborate the performance of the calibrated parameter values for other\\ncyclone events. Finally, the robustness of the calibrated parameters across\\ndifferent boundary conditions and grid resolutions is also examined. These\\nresults will have significant implications for improving the predictability of\\ntropical cyclone characteristics. This allows us to better plan the adaptation\\nand mitigation strategies and thus help in preventing the adverse effects on\\nsociety.\\n Title: Intensity Prediction of Tropical Cyclones using Long Short-Term Memory\\n  Network\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclones can be of varied intensity and cause a huge loss of lives\\nand property if the intensity is high enough. Therefore, the prediction of the\\nintensity of tropical cyclones advance in time is of utmost importance. We\\npropose a novel stacked bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM)\\nbased model architecture to predict the intensity of a tropical cyclone in\\nterms of Maximum surface sustained wind speed (MSWS). The proposed model can\\npredict MSWS well advance in time (up to 72 h) with very high accuracy. We have\\napplied the model on tropical cyclones in the North Indian Ocean from 1982 to\\n2018 and checked its performance on two recent tropical cyclones, namely, Fani\\nand Vayu. The model predicts MSWS (in knots) for the next 3, 12, 24, 36, 48,\\n60, and 72 hours with a mean absolute error of 1.52, 3.66, 5.88, 7.42, 8.96,\\n10.15, and 11.92, respectively.\\n Title: Prediction of Landfall Intensity, Location, and Time of a Tropical\\n  Cyclone\\nSummary:   The prediction of the intensity, location and time of the landfall of a\\ntropical cyclone well advance in time and with high accuracy can reduce human\\nand material loss immensely. In this article, we develop a Long Short-Term\\nmemory based Recurrent Neural network model to predict intensity (in terms of\\nmaximum sustained surface wind speed), location (latitude and longitude), and\\ntime (in hours after the observation period) of the landfall of a tropical\\ncyclone which originates in the North Indian ocean. The model takes as input\\nthe best track data of cyclone consisting of its location, pressure, sea\\nsurface temperature, and intensity for certain hours (from 12 to 36 hours)\\nanytime during the course of the cyclone as a time series and then provide\\npredictions with high accuracy. For example, using 24 hours data of a cyclone\\nanytime during its course, the model provides state-of-the-art results by\\npredicting landfall intensity, time, latitude, and longitude with a mean\\nabsolute error of 4.24 knots, 4.5 hours, 0.24 degree, and 0.37 degree\\nrespectively, which resulted in a distance error of 51.7 kilometers from the\\nlandfall location. We further check the efficacy of the model on three recent\\ndevastating cyclones Bulbul, Fani, and Gaja, and achieved better results than\\nthe test dataset.\\n Title: Tackling the Overestimation of Forest Carbon with Deep Learning and\\n  Aerial Imagery\\nSummary:   Forest carbon offsets are increasingly popular and can play a significant\\nrole in financing climate mitigation, forest conservation, and reforestation.\\nMeasuring how much carbon is stored in forests is, however, still largely done\\nvia expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes unaccountable field measurements.\\nTo overcome these limitations, many verification bodies are leveraging machine\\nlearning (ML) algorithms to estimate forest carbon from satellite or aerial\\nimagery. Aerial imagery allows for tree species or family classification, which\\nimproves the satellite imagery-based forest type classification. However,\\naerial imagery is significantly more expensive to collect and it is unclear by\\nhow much the higher resolution improves the forest carbon estimation. This\\nproposal paper describes the first systematic comparison of forest carbon\\nestimation from aerial imagery, satellite imagery, and ground-truth field\\nmeasurements via deep learning-based algorithms for a tropical reforestation\\nproject. Our initial results show that forest carbon estimates from satellite\\nimagery can overestimate above-ground biomass by up to 10-times for tropical\\nreforestation projects. The significant difference between aerial and\\nsatellite-derived forest carbon measurements shows the potential for aerial\\nimagery-based ML algorithms and raises the importance to extend this study to a\\nglobal benchmark between options for carbon measurements.\\n Title: Stacked transfer learning for tropical cyclone intensity prediction\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclone wind-intensity prediction is a challenging task considering\\ndrastic changes climate patterns over the last few decades. In order to develop\\nrobust prediction models, one needs to consider different characteristics of\\ncyclones in terms of spatial and temporal characteristics. Transfer learning\\nincorporates knowledge from a related source dataset to compliment a target\\ndatasets especially in cases where there is lack or data. Stacking is a form of\\nensemble learning focused for improving generalization that has been recently\\nused for transfer learning problems which is referred to as transfer stacking.\\nIn this paper, we employ transfer stacking as a means of studying the effects\\nof cyclones whereby we evaluate if cyclones in different geographic locations\\ncan be helpful for improving generalization performs. Moreover, we use\\nconventional neural networks for evaluating the effects of duration on cyclones\\nin prediction performance. Therefore, we develop an effective strategy that\\nevaluates the relationships between different types of cyclones through\\ntransfer learning and conventional learning methods via neural networks.\\n Title: Identifying Distributional Differences in Convective Evolution Prior to\\n  Rapid Intensification in Tropical Cyclones\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclone (TC) intensity forecasts are issued by human forecasters who\\nevaluate spatio-temporal observations (e.g., satellite imagery) and model\\noutput (e.g., numerical weather prediction, statistical models) to produce\\nforecasts every 6 hours. Within these time constraints, it can be challenging\\nto draw insight from such data. While high-capacity machine learning methods\\nare well suited for prediction problems with complex sequence data, extracting\\ninterpretable scientific information with such methods is difficult. Here we\\nleverage powerful AI prediction algorithms and classical statistical inference\\nto identify patterns in the evolution of TC convective structure leading up to\\nthe rapid intensification of a storm, hence providing forecasters and\\nscientists with key insight into TC behavior.\\n Title: Attention-Based Scattering Network for Satellite Imagery\\nSummary:   Multi-channel satellite imagery, from stacked spectral bands or\\nspatiotemporal data, have meaningful representations for various atmospheric\\nproperties. Combining these features in an effective manner to create a\\nperformant and trustworthy model is of utmost importance to forecasters. Neural\\nnetworks show promise, yet suffer from unintuitive computations, fusion of\\nhigh-level features, and may be limited by the quantity of available data. In\\nthis work, we leverage the scattering transform to extract high-level features\\nwithout additional trainable parameters and introduce a separation scheme to\\nbring attention to independent input channels. Experiments show promising\\nresults on estimating tropical cyclone intensity and predicting the occurrence\\nof lightning from satellite imagery.\\n Title: Detecting Distributional Differences in Labeled Sequence Data with\\n  Application to Tropical Cyclone Satellite Imagery\\nSummary:   Our goal is to quantify whether, and if so how, spatio-temporal patterns in\\ntropical cyclone (TC) satellite imagery signal an upcoming rapid intensity\\nchange event. To address this question, we propose a new nonparametric test of\\nassociation between a time series of images and a series of binary event\\nlabels. We ask whether there is a difference in distribution between (dependent\\nbut identically distributed) 24-h sequences of images preceding an event versus\\na non-event. By rewriting the statistical test as a regression problem, we\\nleverage neural networks to infer modes of structural evolution of TC\\nconvection that are representative of the lead-up to rapid intensity change\\nevents. Dependencies between nearby sequences are handled by a bootstrap\\nprocedure that estimates the marginal distribution of the label series. We\\nprove that type I error control is guaranteed as long as the distribution of\\nthe label series is well-estimated, which is made easier by the extensive\\nhistorical data for binary TC event labels. We show empirical evidence that our\\nproposed method identifies archetypes of infrared imagery associated with\\nelevated rapid intensification risk, typically marked by deep or deepening core\\nconvection over time. Such results provide a foundation for improved forecasts\\nof rapid intensification.\\n\\n\\n\\nReview and analyze the provided paper summary with respect to the task.
