One of the main differences is that the Ethiopian calendar has 13 months, with 12 months having 30 days each and a 13th month called Pagum\u0113 having 5 or 6 days (depending on whether it's a leap year). This results in the Ethiopian calendar being roughly 7-8 years behind the Gregorian calendar. Additionally, the Ethiopian New Year falls on September 11 or 12 (depending on whether it's a leap year), which is different from the January 1st New Year in the Gregorian calendar.\\n\\nSource: [Wikipedia - Ethiopian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_calendar)", "llm_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo"}
