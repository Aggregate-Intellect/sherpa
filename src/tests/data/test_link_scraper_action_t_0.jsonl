The Ethiopian calendar has 13 months, with 12 months having 30 days each and a 13th month called Pagum\u0113 with 5 or 6 days, depending on whether it is a leap year. This makes the Ethiopian year shorter than the Gregorian year by about 7-8 years.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Ethiopian calendar is about 7-8 years behind the Gregorian calendar. For example, while the year 2021 is recognized in the Gregorian calendar, it is currently the year 2013 in the Ethiopian calendar.\\n\\nThe Ethiopian calendar also has its own unique New Year celebration called Enkutatash, which falls on September 11th (or September 12th in leap years) according to the Gregorian calendar.\\n\\nFor more information, you can visit the official website of the Ethiopian calendar at https://www.ethiopiancalendar.net/.", "llm_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo"}
