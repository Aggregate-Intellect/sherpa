Wikipedia is the largest and most-readreference workin history,[3][4]and is consistently ranked among the tenmost visited websites; as of May\u00a02024[update], it was ranked fifth bySemrush,[5]and sixth bySimilarweb.[6]Founded byJimmy WalesandLarry Sangeron January 15, 2001, Wikipedia has been hosted since 2003 by theWikimedia Foundation, an Americannonprofit organizationfunded mainly by donations from readers.[7]Initially only available inEnglish,editions of Wikipediain more than 300 other languages have been developed. TheEnglish Wikipedia, with its 6.8\u00a0million articles, is the largest of the editions, which together comprise more than 63 million articles and attract more than 1.5\u00a0billion unique device visits and 13\u00a0million edits per month (about 5edits per second on average)  as of April\u00a02024[update].[W 1]Roughly 25% of Wikipedia's traffic is from theUnited States, followed byJapanat 5.8%, theUnited Kingdomat 5.7%,Germanyat 5%,Russiaat 4.9%, and the remaining 54% split among other countries, according to Similarweb.[8]Wikipedia has been praised for its enablement of thedemocratization of knowledge, extent of coverage, unique structure, and culture.It has been criticizedfor exhibitingsystemic bias, particularlygender biasagainst women andgeographical biasagainst theGlobal South(Eurocentrism).[9][10]While thereliability of Wikipediawas frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise from the late 2010s onward[3][11][12]while becomingan important fact-checking site.[13][14]Wikipedia has been censoredby some national governments, ranging from specific pages to the entire site.[15][16]Articles onbreaking newsare often accessed as sources for frequently updated information about those events.[17][18]HistoryMain article:History of WikipediaNupediaMain article:NupediaWikipedia foundersJimmy Wales(left) andLarry Sanger(right)Various collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before the start of Wikipedia, but with limited success.[19]Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.[20]It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership ofBomis, aweb portalcompany. Its main figures were Bomis CEOJimmy WalesandLarry Sanger,editor-in-chieffor Nupedia and later Wikipedia.[1][21]Nupedia was initially licensed under its own NupediaOpen ContentLicense, but before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to theGNU Free Documentation Licenseat the urging ofRichard Stallman.[W 2]Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[22][W 3]while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using awikito reach that goal.[W 4]On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a \"feeder\" project for Nupedia.[W 5]Launch and growthThedomainswikipedia.organdwikipedia.com(later redirecting towikipedia.org) were registered on January 13, 2001,[W 6]and January 12, 2001,[W 7]respectively. Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001[20]as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[W 8]and was announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[22]The name originated from ablendof the wordswikiandencyclopedia.[23][24]Its integral policy of \"neutral point-of-view\"[W 9]was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of Nupedia.[22]Bomis originally intended for it to be a for-profit business.[25]The Wikipedia home page on December 20, 2001[d]Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia,Slashdotpostings, and websearch engineindexing. Language editions were created beginning in March 2001, with a total of 161 in use by the end of 2004.[W 10][W 11]Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. TheEnglish Wikipediapassed the mark of 2\u00a0million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing theYongle Encyclopediamade in China during theMing dynastyin 1408, which had held the record for almost 600\u00a0years.[26]Citing fears of commercialadvertisingand lack of control, users of theSpanish Wikipediaforked from Wikipedia to createEnciclopedia Librein February 2002.[W 12]Wales then announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain fromwikipedia.comtowikipedia.org.[27][W 13]Though the English Wikipedia reached 3\u00a0million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of new articles and of editors, appears to have peaked around early 2007.[28]Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800.[W 14]A team at thePalo Alto Research Centerattributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change.[29]Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called \"low-hanging fruit\"\u2014topics that clearly merit an article\u2014have already been created and built up extensively.[30][31][32]In November 2009, a researcher at theRey Juan Carlos UniversityinMadrid, Spain found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, it lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.[33][34]The Wall Street Journalcited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend.[35]Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the study's methodology.[36]Two years later, in 2011, he acknowledged a slight decline, noting a decrease from \"a little more than 36,000 writers\" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, he also claimed the number of editors was \"stable and sustainable\".[37]A 2013MIT Technology Reviewarticle, \"The Decline of Wikipedia\", questioned this claim, revealing that since 2007, Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and that those remaining had focused increasingly on minutiae.[38]In July 2012,The Atlanticreported that the number of administrators was also in decline.[39]In the November 25, 2013, issue ofNew Yorkmagazine, Katherine Ward stated, \"Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis.\"[40]The number of active English Wikipedia editors has since remained steady after a long period of decline.[41][42]MilestonesCartogramshowing number of articles in each language as of March\u00a02024.[update]Languages with fewer than 1,000,000 articles are represented by one circle. Languages are grouped by region of continent and each region of continent is presented by a separate color.In January 2007, Wikipedia first became one of the tenmost popular websitesin the United States, according toComscoreNetworks.[43]With 42.9\u00a0million unique visitors, it was ranked #9, surpassingThe New York Times(#10) andApple(#11).[43]This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when Wikipedia ranked 33rd, with around 18.3\u00a0million unique visitors.[44]In 2014, it received 8\u00a0billion page views every month.[W 15]On February 9, 2014,The New York Timesreported that Wikipedia had 18\u00a0billionpage viewsand nearly 500\u00a0millionunique visitorsa month, \"according to the ratings firm comScore\".[45]As of March\u00a02023[update], it ranked 6th in popularity, according toSimilarweb.[46]Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that have accumulated improvements piecemeal through \"stigmergicaccumulation\".[47][48]On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in theUnited States Congress\u2014theStop Online Piracy Act(SOPA) and thePROTECT IP Act(PIPA)\u2014byblacking out its pages for 24 hours.[49]More than 162\u00a0million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced its content.[50][W 16]In January 2013,274301 Wikipedia, anasteroid, was named after Wikipedia;[51]in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with theWikipedia Monument;[52]and, in July 2015, 106 of the 7,473 700-page volumes of Wikipedia became available asPrint Wikipedia.[53]In April 2019, an Israelilunar lander,Beresheet, crash landed on the surface of theMooncarrying a copy of nearly all of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash.[54][55]In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16\u00a0GB of article text from the English Wikipedia had been encoded intosynthetic DNA.[56]On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting forThe Economic Timesindicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, it \"had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year. There was a decline of about 2\u00a0billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17\u00a0percent and the Japanese version lost 9\u00a0percent.\"[57]Varma added, \"While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google'sKnowledge Graphsproject launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users.\"[57]When contacted on this matter,Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard'sBerkman Klein Center for Internet & Societysaid that he suspected much of the page-view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, \"If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further].\"[57]By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked the fifth most popular website globally.[58]As of January 2023, 55,791 English Wikipedia articles have been cited 92,300 times in scholarly journals,[59]from whichcloud computingwas the most cited page.[60]On January 18, 2023, Wikipedia debuted a new website redesign, called \"Vector 2022\".[61][62]It featured a redesignedmenu bar, moving thetable of contentsto the left as asidebar, and numerous changes in the locations of buttons like the language selection tool.[62][W 17]The update initially received backlash, most notably when editors of theSwahili Wikipediaunanimously voted to revert the changes.[61][63]OpennessDifferences between versions of an article are highlightedUnlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows theprocrastinationprinciple regarding the security of its content, meaning that it waits until a problem arises to fix it.[64]RestrictionsDue to Wikipedia's increasing popularity, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.[W 18]On the English Wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive, or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to varying degrees.[W 19][65]A frequently vandalized article can be \"semi-protected\" or \"extended confirmed protected\", meaning that only \"autoconfirmed\" or \"extended confirmed\" editors can modify it.[W 19]A particularly contentious article may be locked so that onlyadministratorscan make changes.[W 20]A 2021 article in theColumbia Journalism Reviewidentified Wikipedia's page-protection policies as \"perhaps the most important\" means at its disposal to \"regulate its market of ideas\".[66]In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For example, theGerman Wikipediamaintains \"stable versions\" of articles which have passed certain reviews.[W 21]Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the \"pending changes\" system in December 2012.[67]Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published.[68]Review of changesWikipedia's editing interfaceAlthough changes are not systematically reviewed, Wikipedia's software provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. Each article's History page links to each revision.[e][69]On most articles, anyone can view the latest changes and undo others' revisions by clicking a link on the article's History page.

The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor; it can also include advertising and other types of spam.[71]Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the article's underlying code, or use images disruptively.[W 24]American journalistJohn Seigenthaler(1927\u20132014), subject of theSeigenthaler incidentObvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix it is a few minutes.[72][73]However, some vandalism takes much longer to detect and repair.[74]In theSeigenthaler biography incident, an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figureJohn Seigenthalerin May 2005, falsely presenting him as a suspect in theassassination of John F. Kennedy.[74]It remained uncorrected for four months.[74]Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director ofUSA Todayand founder of the Freedom ForumFirst Amendment CenteratVanderbilt University, called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales said he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced.[75][76]After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as \"a flawed and irresponsible research tool\".[74]The incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia for tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people.[77]Edit warringWikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeated competing changes to an article, known as \"edit warring\".[W 25][78]It is widely seen as a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added,[79]and criticized as creating a competitive[80]and conflict-based editing culture associated with traditional masculinegender roles.[81][82]Taha Yasseriof theUniversity of Oxfordexamined editing conflicts and their resolution in a 2013 study.[83][84]Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \"undo\" operations were not the most significant measure ofcounterproductive work behaviorat Wikipedia. He relied instead on \"mutually reverting edit pairs\", where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor. The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articlesGeorge W. Bush,anarchism, andMuhammad.[84]By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the study were for the articles coveringCroatia,Scientology, and9/11 conspiracy theories.[84]Policies and content\"Five pillars of Wikipedia\" redirects here. For the Wikipedia policy, seeWikipedia:Five pillars.External videosJimmy Wales, The Birth of Wikipedia, 2006,TED talks, 20 minutesKatherine Maher, What Wikipedia Teaches Us About Balancing Truth and Beliefs, 2022,TED talks, 15 minutesContent in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular,copyrightlaws) of the United States and of the US state ofVirginia, where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located.[W 26][W 27]By using the site, one agrees to the Wikimedia FoundationTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy; some of the main rules are that contributors are legally responsible for their edits and contributions, that they should follow the policies that govern each of the independent project editions, and they may not engage in activities, whether legal or illegal, that may be harmful to other users.[W 28][W 29]In addition to the terms, the Foundation has developed policies, described as the \"official policies of the Wikimedia Foundation\".[W 30]The fundamental principles of the Wikipedia community are embodied in the \"Five pillars\", while the detailed editorial principles are expressed in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content.[W 31]The five pillars are:Wikipedia is anencyclopediaWikipedia is written from a neutral point of viewWikipedia is free content that anyone can use, edit, and distributeWikipedia's editors should treat each other with respect and civilityWikipedia has no firm rulesThe rules developed by the community are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines in accordance with community consensus.[85]Editors can enforce the rules bydeletingor modifying non-compliant material.[W 32]Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent.[W 21]The two most commonly usednamespacesacross all editions of Wikipedia are: The article namespace (which are the articles of the encyclopedia) and the category namespace (which is a collection of pages such as articles). In addition, there have been various books and reading lists that are composed completely of articles and categories of a certain Wikipedia.Content policies and guidelinesAccording to the rules on the English Wikipedia community, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that isencyclopedicand is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style.[W 33]A topic should also meetWikipedia's standards of \"notability\", which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject.[W 34]Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized.[W 35]It must not present original research.[W 36]A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source, as do all quotations.[W 33]Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as \"verifiability, not truth\" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.[W 37]This can at times lead to the removal of information which, though valid, is not properly sourced.[86]Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides.[W 38]GovernanceFurther information:Wikipedia:AdministrationWikipedia's initialanarchyintegrateddemocraticandhierarchicalelements over time.[87][88]An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article.[W 39]AdministratorsMain article:Wikipedia administratorsEditors in good standing in the community can request extrauser rights, granting them the technical ability to perform certain special actions. In particular, editors can choose to run for \"adminship\",[89]which includes the ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of severe vandalism or editorial disputes.[W 40]Administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive edits.[W 40]By 2012, fewer editors were becoming administrators compared to Wikipedia's earlier years, in part because the process of vetting potential administrators had become more rigorous.[90]In 2022, there was a particularly contentious request for adminship over the candidate's anti-Trump views; ultimately, they were granted adminship.[91]Dispute resolutionOver time, Wikipedia has developed a semiformal dispute resolution process. To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums, seek outside input through third opinion requests, or initiate a more general community discussion known as a \"request for comment\".[W 25]Wikipedia encourages local resolutions of conflicts, which Jemielniak argues is quite unique in organization studies, though there has been some recent interest inconsensus buildingin the field.[92]Joseph ReagleandSue Gardnerargue that the approaches to consensus building are similar to those used byQuakers.[92]:\u200a62A difference from Quaker meetings is the absence of afacilitatorin the presence of disagreement, a role played by the clerk in Quaker meetings.[92]:\u200a83Arbitration CommitteeMain article:Arbitration Committee (Wikipedia)The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted.[93]Statistical analyzes suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,[94]functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate.[93]Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased).[f]Commonly used solutions include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%).[93]Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances ofimpersonationandanti-social behavior.[W 41]When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather edit warring and other violations of editing policies, solutions tend to be limited to warnings.[93]CommunityMain article:Wikipedia communityVideo ofWikimania 2005\u2013 an annual conference for users of Wikipedia and other projects operated by theWikimedia Foundation, was held inFrankfurt am Main, Germany, August 4\u20138.Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated and dedicated \"talk\" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate.[95]Wikipedians andBritish Museumcurators collaborate on the articleHoxne Hoardin June 2010Wikipedia's community has been described ascultlike,[96]although not always with entirely negative connotations.[97]Its preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard ofcredentials, has been referred to as \"anti-elitism\".[W 42]Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification.[98]As Wikipedia grew, \"Who writes Wikipedia?\" became one of the questions frequently asked there.[99]Jimmy Wales once argued that only \"a community\u00a0... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers\" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore \"much like any traditional organization\".[100]In 2008, aSlatemagazine article reported that: \"According to researchers in Palo Alto, one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits.\"[101]This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed byAaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.[102]The English Wikipedia has6,838,309articles,47,568,319registered editors, and117,283active editors. An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30\u00a0days.[W 43]Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a \"baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references\".[103]Editors who do not log in are in some sense \"second-class citizens\" on Wikipedia,[103]as \"participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation\",[104]but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by theirIP addressescannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.[104]StudiesA 2007 study by researchers fromDartmouth Collegefound that \"anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia\u00a0... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site\".[105]Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that \"[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just 0.7% of the users\u00a0... 524 people\u00a0... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.\"[100]However,Business Insidereditor and journalistHenry Blodgetshowed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most Wikipedia content (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by \"outsiders\", while most editing and formatting is done by \"insiders\".[100]A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others,[106]although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small.[107]According to a 2009 study, there is \"evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content\".[108]DiversitySeveral studies have shown that most Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13\u00a0percent of Wikipedia editors were female.[109]Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage women to become Wikipedia contributors.[110]Similarly, many of these universities, includingYaleandBrown, gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology.[110]Andrew Lih, a professor and scientist, said that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to \"ugly, intimidating behavior\".[111]Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors.[112]Language editionsMain article:List of WikipediasDistribution of the 63,162,470 articles in different language editions (as of June 20, 2024)[\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n            CONCISE SUMMARY: The text is best summarized as", "agent": "human"}], "output": "The text discusses various aspects of Wikipedia, including vandalism, edit warring, policies and content guidelines, governance, dispute resolution, the Wikipedia community, studies on Wikipedia contributors, and diversity among contributors.

These differences may lead to some conflicts overspelling differences(e.g.colourversuscolor)[W 48]or points of view.[W 49]Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as \"neutral point of view\", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are notlicensed freelymay be used under a claim offair use.[W 50][114]Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as \"an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language\".[W 51]Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others).[W 52]For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,[W 53]and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.[W 54]The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics.[W 54]It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet the notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.[W 34]Estimation of contributions shares from different regions in the world to different Wikipedia editions[115]Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles. Articles available in more than one language may offer \"interwiki links\", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.[116][W 55]A study published byPLOS Onein 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for theSimple English Wikipedia.[115]English Wikipedia editor numbersOn March 1, 2014,The Economist, in an article titled \"The Future of Wikipedia\", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the Wikimedia Foundation stating that \"the number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years.\"[117]The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited byThe Economistas substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia).The Economistreported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.[117]In contrast, the trend analysis for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) shows success in retaining active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000. No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively improving substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia.[117]ReceptionSee also:Academic studies about Wikipedia,Criticism of Wikipedia, andRacial bias on WikipediaVariousWikipedianshavecriticized Wikipedia's large and growing regulation, which includes more than fifty policies and nearly 150,000 words as of 2014.[update][118][92]Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibitssystemic bias. In 2010, columnist and journalistEdwin Blackdescribed Wikipedia as being a mixture of \"truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods\".[119]Articles inThe Chronicle of Higher EducationandThe Journal of Academic Librarianshiphave criticized Wikipedia's \"Undue Weight\" policy, concluding that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information.[120][121][122]JournalistsOliver KammandEdwin Blackalleged (in 2010 and 2011 respectively) that articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an \"ax to grind\" on the topic.[119][123]A 2008 article inEducation NextJournal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation andspin.[124]In 2020, Omer Benjakob and Stephen Harrison noted that \"Media coverage of Wikipedia has radically shifted over the past two decades: once cast as an intellectual frivolity, it is now lauded as the 'last bastion of shared reality' online.\"[125]Multiple news networks and pundits have accused Wikipedia of beingideologically biased. In February 2021,Fox Newsaccused Wikipedia of whitewashingcommunismandsocialismand having too much \"leftistbias\".[126]Wikipedia co-founder Sanger said that Wikipedia has become a \"propaganda\" for the left-leaning \"establishment\" and warned the site can no longer be trusted.[127]In 2022, libertarianJohn Stosselopined that Wikipedia, a site he financially supported at one time, appeared to have gradually taken a significant turn in bias to the political left, specifically on political topics.[128]Some studies highlight the fact that Wikipedia (and in particular the English Wikipedia) has a \"western cultural bias\" (or \"pro-western bias\")[129]or \"Eurocentric bias\",[130]reiterating, says Anna Samoilenko, \"similar biases that are found in the 'ivory tower' of academic historiography\". Due to this persistent Eurocentrism, scholars like Carwil Bjork-James[131]or the authors of ''The colonization of Wikipedia: evidence from characteristic editing behaviors of warring camps'\"[132]call for a \"decolonization\" of Wikipedia.Accuracy of contentMain article:Reliability of WikipediaExternal audioThe Great Book of Knowledge, Part 1,Ideas withPaul Kennedy,CBC, January 15, 2014Articles for traditional encyclopedias such asEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannicaare written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy.[133]However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia andEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannicaby the science journalNaturefound few differences in accuracy, and concluded that \"the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies;Britannica, about three.\"[134]Joseph Reagle suggested that while the study reflects \"a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors\" in science articles, \"Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects.\"[135]Others raised similar critiques.[136]The findings byNaturewere disputed byEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica,[137][138]and in response,Naturegave a rebuttal of the points raised byBritannica.[139]In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in theNatureeffort, and suggested a \"flawed study design\" (inNature's manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reportedconfidence intervals), and a lack of study \"statistical power\" (i.e., owing to smallsample size, 42 or 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0101articles compared, vs >105and >106set sizes forBritannicaand the English Wikipedia, respectively).[140]As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia \"makes no guarantee of validity\" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it.[W 56]Concerns have been raised byPC Worldin 2009 regarding the lack ofaccountabilitythat results from users' anonymity,[141][full citation needed]the insertion of false information,[142]vandalism, and similar problems.EconomistTyler Cowenwrote: \"If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia.\" He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases, and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles as well as relevant information being omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them.[143]Amy Bruckmanhas argued that, due to the number of reviewers, \"the content of a popular Wikipedia page is actually the most reliable form of information ever created\".[144]In September 2022,The Sydney Morning Heraldjournalist Liam Mannix noted that, \"There's no reason to expect Wikipedia to be accurate\u00a0... And yet it [is].\" Mannix further discussed the multiple studies that have proved Wikipedia to be generally as reliable asEncyclopedia Britannica, summarizing that, \"...turning our back on such an extraordinary resource is... well, a little petty.\"[145]Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable.[146]Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear.[147]Editors of traditionalreference workssuch as theEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannicahave questioned the project'sutilityand status as an encyclopedia.[148]Wikipedia co-founderJimmy Waleshas claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of \"fake news\" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles.[149]External videosInside Wikipedia\u00a0\u2013 Attack of the PR Industry,Deutsche Welle, 7:13 mins[150]Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target forInternet trolls,spammers, and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia.[69][W 57]In response topaid advocacy editingand undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article inThe Wall Street Journalto have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing.[151]The article stated that: \"Beginning Monday [from the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement.Katherine Maher, the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that, 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia.'\"[151][152][153][154][155]These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably byStephen ColbertonThe Colbert Report.[156]Legal Research in a Nutshell(2011), cites Wikipedia as a \"general source\" that \"can be a real boon\" in \"coming up to speed in the law governing a situation\" and, \"while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources\".[157]Discouragement in educationSome universitylecturersdiscourage students from citing any encyclopedia inacademic work, preferringprimary sources;[158]some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n            CONCISE SUMMARY: The text is best summarized as", "agent": "human"}], "output": "The text provides information about the different language editions of Wikipedia, the number of articles in each edition, the distribution of traffic among languages, the editing trends, criticisms of Wikipedia, concerns about accuracy, and the impact of Wikipedia on education.

The experimental group was instructed to learn before class and get immediate feedback before going in (the flipped classroom model), while the control group was given direct instructions in class (the conventional classroom model). The groups were then instructed to collaboratively develop Wikipedia entries, which would be graded in quality after the study. The results showed that the experimental group yielded more Wikipedia entries and received higher grades in quality. The study concluded that learning with Wikipedia in flipped classrooms was more effective than in conventional classrooms, demonstrating Wikipedia could be used as an educational tool in higher education.[166]Medical informationSee also:Health information on WikipediaOn March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing forThe Atlanticmagazine in an article titled \"Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia\", stated that \"Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information.\"[167]Beck continued to detail in this article new programs ofAmin Azzamat theUniversity of San Franciscoto offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improveWikipedia articles on health-related issues, as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized byJames Heilmanto improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process.[167]In a May 7, 2014, follow-up article inThe Atlantictitled \"Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?\", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's James Heilman as stating: \"Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference.\"[168]Beck added that: \"Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured'.

Since it hasterabytesofdisk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia.[W 58]The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (seedeletionism and inclusionism).[169][170]Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic.[W 59]The \"Wikipedia is not censored\" policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion ofimages of Muhammadin theEnglish editionof itsMuhammadarticle, citing this policy.[171]The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to thecensorship of Wikipediaby national authorities in China[172]and Pakistan,[173]amongst other countries.[174][175][176]Through its \"Wikipedia Loves Libraries\" program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as theNew York Public Library for the Performing Artsto expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles.[177]A 2011 study conducted by researchers at theUniversity of Minnesotaindicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the \"people and arts\" category, while males focus more on \"geography and science\".[178]Coverage of topics and biasResearch conducted by Mark Graham of theOxford Internet Institutein 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven, Africa being the most underrepresented.[179]Across 30 language editions of Wikipedia, historical articles and sections are generally Eurocentric and focused on recent events.[180]An editorial inThe Guardianin 2014 claimed that more effort went into providing references fora list of female porn actorsthan alist of women writers.[181]Data has also shown that Africa-related material often faces omission; a knowledge gap that a July 2018 Wikimedia conference inCape Townsought to address.[112]Systemic biasesAcademic studies of Wikipediahave consistently shown that Wikipedia systematically over-represents a point of view (POV) belonging to a particular demographic described as the \"average Wikipedian\", who is an educated, technically inclined, English speaking white male, aged 15\u201349 from a developed Christian country in the northern hemisphere.[182]This POV is over-represented in relation to all existing POVs.[183][184]This systemic bias in editor demographic results in cultural bias,gender bias, andgeographical bias on Wikipedia.[185][186]There are two broad types of bias, which areimplicit(when a topic is omitted) andexplicit(when a certain POV is over-represented in an article or by references).[183]Interdisciplinary scholarly assessments of Wikipedia articles have found that while articles are typically accurate and free of misinformation, they are also typically incomplete and fail to present all perspectives with a neutral point of view.[185]In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example \"biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare\".[37]The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT'sTechnology Reviewtitled \"The Decline of Wikipedia\" discussed the effect of systemic bias andpolicy creepon thedownward trend in the number of editors.[38]Explicit contentSee also:Internet Watch Foundation and WikipediaandReporting of child pornography images on Wikimedia CommonsFor the government censorship of Wikipedia, seeCensorship of Wikipedia.For Wikipedia's policy concerning censorship, seeWikipedia:Wikipedia is not censoredWikipedia has been criticized for allowing information about graphic content.[187]Articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content (such asfeces,cadaver,human penis,vulva, andnudity) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children.[W 60]The site also includessexual contentsuch as images and videos ofmasturbationandejaculation, illustrations ofzoophilia, and photos fromhardcore pornographicfilms in its articles. It also has non-sexualphotographs of nude children.[W 61]The Wikipedia article aboutVirgin Killer\u2014a 1976 album from the GermanrockbandScorpions\u2014features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a nakedprepubescentgirl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia articleVirgin Killerwas blocked for four days by mostInternet service providersin the United Kingdom after theInternet Watch Foundation(IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a \"blacklist\" it supplies to British internet service providers.[188]In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images onWikimedia Commonscontained child pornography, and were in violation ofUS federal obscenity law.[189][190]Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related topedophiliaand one aboutlolicon, were not of real children, but said that they constituted \"obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children\", under thePROTECT Act of 2003.[191]That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that areobscene under American law.[191]Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools.[192]Wikimedia Foundationspokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation,[193]saying that Wikipedia did not have \"material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it.\"[193]Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteered to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was \"in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted\".[194]Critics, includingWikipediocracy, noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared.[195]PrivacyOneprivacyconcern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a \"private citizen\" rather than a \"public figure\" in the eyes of the law.[196][g]It is a battle between the right to be anonymous incyberspaceand the right to be anonymous inreal life. The Wikimedia Foundation'sprivacy policystates, \"we believe that you shouldn't have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement\", and states that \"personal information\" may be shared \"For legal reasons\", \"To Protect You, Ourselves & Others\", or \"To Understand & Experiment\".[W 62]In January 2006, a German court ordered theGerman Wikipediashut down within Germany because it stated the full name ofBoris Floricic, aka \"Tron\", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron'sright to privacyor that of his parents was being violated.[197]Wikipedia has a \"Volunteer Response Team\" that uses Znuny, afree and open-source softwarefork ofOTRS[W 63]to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project.[W 64]In late April 2023, Wikimedia Foundation announced that Wikipedia will not submit to any age verifications that may be required by the Online Safety Bill. Rebecca MacKinnon of the Wikimedia Foundation said that such checks would run counter to the website's commitment to minimal data collection on its contributors and readers.[198]SexismMain article:Gender bias on WikipediaWikipedia was described in 2015 as harboring a battleground culture ofsexismandharassment.[199][200]The perceived tolerance of abusive language was a reason put forth in 2013 for the gender gap in Wikipedia editorship.[201]Edit-a-thonshave been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.[202]In May 2018, a Wikipedia editor rejected a submitted article aboutDonna Stricklanddue to lack of coverage in the media.[W 65][203]Five months later, Strickland won aNobel Prize in Physics\"for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics\", becoming the third woman to ever receive the award.[203][204]Prior to winning the award, Strickland's only mention on Wikipedia was in the article about her collaborator and co-winner of the awardG\u00e9rard Mourou.[203]Her exclusion from Wikipedia led to accusations of sexism, but Corinne Purtill writing forQuartzargued that \"it's also a pointed lesson in the hazards of gender bias in media, and of the broader consequences of underrepresentation.\"[205]Purtill attributes the issue to the gender bias in media coverage.[205]A comprehensive 2008 survey, published in 2016, by Julia B. Bear ofStony Brook University's College of Business and Benjamin Collier ofCarnegie Mellon Universityfound significant gender differences in confidence in expertise, discomfort with editing, and response to critical feedback. \"Women reported less confidence in their expertise, expressed greater discomfort with editing (which typically involves conflict), and reported more negative responses to critical feedback compared to men.\"[206]OperationWikimedia Foundation and affiliate movementsMain article:Wikimedia FoundationKatherine Maher, the third executive director of Wikimedia, served from 2016 to 2021.Wikipedia is hosted and funded by theWikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such asWiktionaryandWikibooks.[W 66]The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission.[207][W 67]The foundation's 2020 Internal Revenue ServiceForm 990shows revenue of $124.6\u00a0million and expenses of almost $112.2\u00a0million, with assets of about $191.2\u00a0million and liabilities of almost $11\u00a0million.[W 68]In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation namedLila Tretikovas its second executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner.[W 69]TheWall Street Journalreported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, \"Information, like air, wants to be free.\"[208][209]The sameWall Street Journalarticle reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who \"said Tretikov would address that issue (paid advocacy) as a priority.

She said toBloomberg Businessweekregarding the harassment issue that: \"It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority\u00a0... [and that correction requires that] it has to be more than words.\"[111]Maher served as executive director until April 2021.[210]Maryana Iskanderwas named the incoming CEO in September 2021, and took over that role in January 2022. She stated that one of her focuses would be increasing diversity in the Wikimedia community.[211]Wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently-run, calledWikimedia movement affiliates. These includeWikimedia chapters(which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikimedia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for theCatalan languagecommunity), and user groups. These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.[W 72]Software operations and supportSee also:MediaWikiThe operation of Wikipedia depends onMediaWiki, a custom-made,freeand open sourcewiki softwareplatform written inPHPand built upon theMySQLdatabase system.[W 73]The software incorporates programming features such as amacro language,variables, atransclusionsystem fortemplates, andURL redirection.[W 74]MediaWiki is licensed under theGNU General Public License(GPL) and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects.[W 73][W 75]Originally, Wikipedia ran onUseModWikiwritten inPerlby Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially requiredCamelCasefor article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later.[W 76]Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on aPHP wikiengine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia byMagnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate theexponentially increasingdemand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written byLee Daniel Crocker.Several MediaWiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.[W 77]In April 2005, aLuceneextension[W 78][W 79]was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. Lucene was later replaced by CirrusSearch which is based onElasticsearch.[W 80]In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, aWYSIWYG(What You See Is What You Get) extension,VisualEditor, was opened to public use.[212][213][214]It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as \"slow and buggy\".[215]The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.[W 81]Automated editingMain article:Wikipedia botsComputer programs calledbotshave often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data.[W 82][216][217]One controversial contributor,Sverker Johansson, created articles with his botLsjbot, which was reported to create up to 10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days.[218]Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses).[W 83]Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly.[216]Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts orIP addressranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of theMH17 jetin July 2014 when it was reported that edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government.[219]Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation.[W 84]According toAndrew Lih, the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots.[220]Hardware operations and supportAs of 2021,[update]page requests are first passed to a front-end layer ofVarnishcaching servers and back-end layercachingis done byApache Traffic Server.[W 85]Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to load-balancing servers running theLinux Virtual Serversoftware, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database.[W 85]The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses.[221]Overview of system architecture as of August\u00a02022[update]Wikipedia currently runs on dedicatedclustersofLinuxservers running theDebianoperating system.[W 86]As of February\u00a02023,[update]caching clusters are located inAmsterdam,San Francisco,Singapore, andMarseille.[W 27][W 87]By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to anEquinixfacility inAshburn, Virginia.[W 88][222]In 2017, Wikipedia installed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility inSingapore, the first of its kind in Asia.[W 89]In 2022, a caching data center was opened inMarseille,France.[W 90]Internal research and operational developmentFollowing growing amounts of incoming donations in 2013 exceeding seven digits,[38]the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles ofindustrial organizationeconomics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation.[223]Two projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and the \"Thank\" tab in the edit history, which were developed to improve issues of editor attrition.[38][215]The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied byAdam Jaffe, who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high-end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment.[224]At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45\u00a0million dollars,[W 91]the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8\u00a0million and 11.3\u00a0million dollars annually.[224]In 2019, the level of contributions were reported by the Wikimedia Foundation as being at $120\u00a0million annually,[W 92]updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between $3.08\u00a0million and $19.2\u00a0million annually.[224]Internal news publicationsMain article:The SignpostMultiple Wikimedia projects have internal news publications.Wikimedia'sonline newspaperThe Signpostwas founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator who would join the Wikimedia Foundation's board of trustees in 2008.[225][226]The publication covers news and events from the English Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation, andWikipedia's sister projects.[W 93]The Wikipedia LibraryFor information for Wikipedia editors, seeWikipedia:The Wikipedia Library.Wikipedia LibraryThe Wikipedia Library is a resource for Wikipedia editors which provides free access to a wide range ofdigital publications, so that they can consult and cite these while editing the encyclopedia.[227][228]Over 60 publishers have partnered with The Wikipedia Library to provide access to their resources: whenICE Publishingjoined in 2020, a spokesman said \"By enabling free access to our content for Wikipedia editors, we hope to further the research community's resources \u2013 creating and updating Wikipedia entries on civil engineering which are read by thousands of monthly readers.\"[229]Access to content\"Accessing Wikipedia\" redirects here. For our accessibility guidelines, seeWikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility.Content licensingWhen the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by theGNU Free Documentation License(GFDL), acopyleftlicense permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work.[W 26]The GFDL was created for software manuals that come withfree softwareprograms licensed under theGPL. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text.[230]In December 2002, theCreative Commons licensewas released; it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.[W 94]Because the GFDL and Creative Commons were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, theFree Software Foundation(FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA by August 1, 2009.[W 95]In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.[W 96][W 97][W 98][W 99]The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files underfair usedoctrine,[W 100]while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. inJapanese copyright law). Media files covered byfree contentlicenses (e.g.Creative Commons'CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions viaWikimedia Commonsrepository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation.[W 101]Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text.[231]The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content on Wikipedia or its related projects but merely a hosting service for contributors to and licensors of Wikipedia, a position which was successfully defended in 2004 in a court in France.[232][233]Methods of accessBecause Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge.[W 102]The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website.Thousands of \"mirror sites\" exist that republish content from Wikipedia; two prominent ones that also include content from other reference sources areReference.comandAnswers.com.[234][235]Another example isWapedia, which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did.[W 103]Some websearch enginesmake special use of Wikipedia content when displaying search results: examples includeMicrosoft Bing(via technology gained fromPowerset)[236]andDuckDuckGo.Collections of Wikipedia articles have been published onoptical discs. An English version released in 2006 contained about 2,000 articles.[W 104]The Polish-language version from 2006 contains nearly 240,000 articles,[W 105]the German-language version from 2007/2008 contains over 620,000 articles,[W 106]and the Spanish-language version from 2011 contains 886,000 articles.[W 107]Additionally, \"Wikipedia for Schools\", the Wikipedia series of CDs / DVDs produced by Wikipedia andSOS Children, is a free selection from Wikipedia designed for education towards children eight to seventeen.[W 108]There have been efforts to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form.[237][W 109]Since 2009, tens of thousands ofprint-on-demandbooks that reproduced English, German, Russian, and French Wikipedia articles have been produced by the American companyBooks LLCand by threeMauritiansubsidiaries of the German publisherVDM.[238]The websiteDBpedia, begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia.[239]Wikimedia has created theWikidataproject with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia Foundation projects and make it available in a queryablesemanticformat,RDF.[W 110]As of February\u00a02023,[update]it has over 101\u00a0million items.[W 111]WikiReaderis a dedicated reader device that contains an offline copy of Wikipedia, which was launched byOpenMokoand first released in 2009.[W 112]Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via aweb crawleris discouraged.[W 113]Wikipedia publishes \"dumps\" of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2023,[update]there is no dump available of Wikipedia's images.[W 114]Wikimedia Enterpriseis a for-profit solution to this.[240]Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in theJournal of Documentation, the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard libraryreference desk, with an accuracy of 55percent.[241]Mobile accessSee also:List of Wikipedia mobile applicationsandHelp:Mobile accessA mobile version showing the English Wikipedia's Main Page, on August 3, 2019Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standardweb browserthrough a fixedInternet connection.

The article inThe New York Timesreported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \"Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent.

One principal concern cited byThe New York Timesfor the \"worry\" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.[45]By 2023, the Wikimedia Foundation's staff had grown to over 700 employees.[7]Bloomberg Businessweekreported in July 2014 that Google's Android mobile apps have dominated the largest share of global smartphone shipments for 2013, with 78.6% of market share over their next closest competitor in iOS with 15.2% of the market.[242]At the time of the appointment of new Wikimedia Foundation executive Lila Tretikov, Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to Wikipedia. Soon after, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access, includingBlackBerryand theWindows Phonesystem, making market share a secondary issue.[209]The Android app for Wikipedia was released on July 23, 2014, to over 500,000 installs and generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google.[W 115][W 116]The version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews.[W 117]Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through theWireless Application Protocol(WAP), via theWapediaservice.[W 103]In June 2007, Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009, a newer mobile service was officially released, located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as theiPhone,Android-based devices, orWebOS-based devices.[W 118]Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged since. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipediametadatalikegeoinformation.[243][244]Wikipedia Zerowas an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries by partnering with mobile operators to allow free access.[W 119][245]It was discontinued in February 2018 due to lack of participation from mobile operators.[W 119]Andrew LihandAndrew Brownboth maintain editing Wikipedia withsmartphonesis difficult and this discourages new potential contributors.[246][247]Lih states that the number of Wikipedia editors has been declining after several years,[246]and Tom Simonite ofMIT Technology Reviewclaims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges someWikipediansuse the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping thestatus quo.[38]Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.[246][247]Chinese accessAccess to Wikipedia has beenblockedinmainland Chinasince May 2015.[16][248][249]This was done after Wikipedia started to useHTTPSencryption, which made selective censorship more difficult.[250]Cultural influenceTrusted source to combat fake newsIn 2017\u201318, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news.[13][14]Noam Cohen, writing inThe Washington Poststates, \"YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out 'fake news'.\"[14][251]ReadershipIn February 2014,The New York Timesreported that Wikipedia was ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating \"With 18\u00a0billion page views and nearly 500\u00a0million unique visitors a month,\u00a0... Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2\u00a0billion unique visitors.\"[45]However, its ranking dropped to 13th globally by June 2020 due mostly to a rise in popularity of Chinese websites for online shopping.[252]The website has since recovered its ranking as of April 2022.[253]In addition tologistic growthin the number of its articles,[W 120]Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001.[254]The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365\u00a0million at the end of 2009.[W 121]ThePewInternet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia.[255]In 2011,Business Insidergave Wikipedia a valuation of $4\u00a0billion if it ran advertisements.[256]According to \"Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011\", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization.[W 122]As of February\u00a02023,[update]Wikipedia attracts around 2\u00a0billion unique devices monthly, with the English Wikipedia receiving 10\u00a0billionpageviewseach month.[W 1]COVID-19 pandemicMain article:Wikipedia coverage of the COVID-19 pandemicDuring theCOVID-19 pandemic, Wikipedia's coverage of the pandemic and fight against misinformation received international media attention, and brought an increase in Wikipedia readership overall.[257][258][259][260]Noam Cohen wrote inWiredthat Wikipedia's effort to combatmisinformation related to the pandemicwas different from other major websites, opining, \"UnlessTwitter,Facebookandthe otherscan learn to address misinformation more effectively, Wikipedia will remain the last best place on the Internet.\"[258]In October 2020, theWorld Health Organizationannounced they were freely licensing itsinfographicsand other materials on Wikimedia projects.[261]There were nearly 7,000 COVID-19 related Wikipedia articles across 188 different Wikipedias, as of November\u00a02021.[update][262][263]Cultural significanceMain article:Wikipedia in cultureWikipedia MonumentinS\u0142ubice, Poland, byMihran Hakobyan(2014)Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases.[W 123][264][265]TheParliament of Canada's website refers to Wikipedia's article onsame-sex marriagein the \"related links\" section of its \"further reading\" list for theCivil Marriage Act.[266]The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and theWorld Intellectual Property Organization[267]\u2014though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case.[268]Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in someUS intelligence agencyreports.[269]In December 2008, the scientific journalRNA Biologylaunched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on theRNA familyfor publication in Wikipedia.[270]Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism,[271][272]often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed forplagiarizing from Wikipedia.[273][274][275][276]In 2006,Timemagazine recognized Wikipedia's participation (along withYouTube,Reddit,MySpace, andFacebook) in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide.[277]On September 16, 2007,The Washington Postreported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the2008 US election campaign, saying: \"Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day.\"[278]An October 2007Reutersarticle, titled \"Wikipedia page the latest status symbol\", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability.[279]One of the first times Wikipedia was involved in a governmental affair was on September 28, 2007, whenItalianpoliticianFranco Grilliniraised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity offreedom of panorama. He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, \"the seventh most consulted website\", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues.[280]Wikipedia, an introduction \u2013Erasmus Prize2015Jimmy Walesaccepts the 2008QuadrigaA Mission of Enlightenmentaward on behalf of Wikipedia.A working group led byPeter Stone(formed as a part of theStanford-based projectOne Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence) in its report called Wikipedia \"the best-known example of crowdsourcing... that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth\".[281][282]In a 2017 opinion piece forWired,Hossein Derakhshandescribes Wikipedia as \"one of the last remaining pillars of theopenanddecentralized web\" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of knowledge withsocial mediaandsocial networking services, the latter having \"since colonized the web for television's values\". For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents theAge of Enlightenmenttradition ofrationalitytriumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers \"endangered\" due to the \"gradual shift from atypographicculture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment\". Rather than \"sapere aude\" (lit.'dare to know'), social networks have led to a culture of \"dare not to care to know\". This is while Wikipedia faces \"a more concerning problem\" than funding, namely \"a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website\". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to \"save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television\u2014how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know.\"[283]AwardsWikipedia team visiting the Parliament of AsturiasWikipedians meeting after the 2015 Asturias awards ceremonyWikipedia has won many awards, receiving its first two major awards in May 2004.[W 124]The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annualPrix Ars Electronicacontest; this came with a \u20ac10,000 (\u00a36,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later that year. The second was a Judges'Webby Awardfor the \"community\" category.[284]In 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15 percent of the votes in answer to the question \"Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?\"[285]In September 2008, Wikipedia receivedQuadrigaA Mission of Enlightenmentaward of Werkstatt Deutschland along withBoris Tadi\u0107,Eckart H\u00f6fling, andPeter Gabriel. The award was presented to Wales byDavid Weinberger.[286]In 2015, Wikipedia was awarded both the annualErasmus Prize, which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social sciences,[287]and the SpanishPrincess of Asturias Awardon International Cooperation.[288]Speaking at the Asturian Parliament in Oviedo, the city that hosts the awards ceremony,Jimmy Walespraised the work of theAsturian Wikipediausers.[289]SatireSee also:Category:Parodies of WikipediaMany parodies target Wikipedia's openness and susceptibility to inserted inaccuracies, with characters vandalizing or modifying the online encyclopedia project's articles.ComedianStephen Colberthas parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his showThe Colbert Reportand coined the related termwikiality, meaning \"together we can create a reality that we all agree on\u2014the reality we just agreed on\".[156]Another example can be found in \"Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence\", a July 2006 front-page article inThe Onion,[290]as well as the 2010The Onionarticle\"'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today\".[291]In an April 2007 episode of the American television comedyThe Office, office manager (Michael Scott) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information onnegotiationtactics to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee.[292]Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page.[293]\"My Number One Doctor\", a 2007 episode of the television showScrubs, played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in whichPerry Coxreacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that theraw food dietreverses the effects ofbone cancerby retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote theBattlestar Galacticaepisode guide.[294]In 2008, the comedy websiteCollegeHumorproduced a video sketch named \"Professor Wikipedia\", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements.[295]TheDilbertcomic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying \"Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia.\"[296]In July 2009,BBC Radio 4broadcast a comedy series calledBigipedia, which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia.[297]Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles.[298]On August 23, 2013, theNew Yorkerwebsite published a cartoon with this caption: \"Dammit, Manning, have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?\"[299]The cartoon referred toChelsea Elizabeth Manning(born Bradley Edward Manning), an Americanactivist,politician, and former\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n            CONCISE SUMMARY: The text is best summarized as", "agent": "human"}], "output": "The text discusses the growth and development of Wikipedia, including its mobile access, cultural significance, readership, and response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Carr wrote, \"Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is thehegemonyof the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening.\"[309]Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications.Chris Anderson, the former editor-in-chief ofWired, wrote inNaturethat the \"wisdom of crowds\" approach of Wikipedia will not displace topscientific journalswith rigorouspeer reviewprocesses.[310]Wikipedia's influence on the biography publishing business has been a concern for some. Book publishing data tracker NielsenBookScanstated in 2013 that biography sales were dropping \"far more sharply\".[311]Kathryn Hughes, professor oflife writingat theUniversity of East Angliaand author of two biographies wrote, \"The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?\"[311]Research useWikipedia has been widely used as acorpusfor linguistic research incomputational linguistics,information retrievalandnatural language processing.[312][313]In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for theentity linkingproblem, which is then called \"wikification\",[314]and to the related problem ofword-sense disambiguation.[315]Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find \"missing\" links in Wikipedia.[316]In 2015, French researchers Jos\u00e9 Lages of theUniversity of Franche-Comt\u00e9inBesan\u00e7onand Dima Shepelyansky ofPaul Sabatier UniversityinToulousepublished a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations.[317][318][319]They usedPageRank,CheiRankand similar algorithms \"followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order)\".[319][320]The study was updated in 2019.[321]A 2017MITstudy suggests that words used on Wikipedia articles end up in scientific publications.[322][323]Studies related to Wikipedia have been usingmachine learningandartificial intelligence[282]to support various operations. One of the most important areas is the automatic detection of vandalism[324][325]anddata qualityassessment in Wikipedia.[326][327]In February 2022,civil servantsfrom the UK'sDepartment for Levelling Up, Housing and Communitieswere found to have used Wikipedia for research in the drafting of theLevelling Up White Paperafter journalists atThe Independentnoted that parts of thedocumenthad been lifted directly from Wikipedia articles onConstantinopleand thelist of largest cities throughout history.[328]Related projectsSeveral interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986BBC Domesday Project, which included text (entered onBBC Microcomputers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.[329]Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g.Everything2),[330]with many later being merged into the project (e.g.GNE).[W 131]One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public wash2g2, which was created byDouglas Adamsin 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.[331]Subsequent collaborativeknowledgewebsites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Others use more traditionalpeer review, such asEncyclopedia of Lifeand the online wiki encyclopediasScholarpediaandCitizendium.[332][333]The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.[334][335]See alsoMain category:WikipediaInternet portalWikipedia portalDemocratization of knowledgeInterpedia, an early proposal for a collaborativeInternetencyclopediaList of films about WikipediaList of online encyclopediasList of Wikipedia controversiesList of wikisNetwork effectOutline of Wikipedia\u2013 guide to the subject ofWikipediapresented as atree structuredlist of its subtopics; for an outline of the contents of Wikipedia, seePortal:Contents/OutlinesQRpedia\u2013 multilingual, mobile interface to WikipediaWikipedia ReviewNotes^Registration is required for certain tasks, such as editing protected pages, creating pages on the English Wikipedia, and uploading files.^To be consideredactive, a user must make at least one edit or other action in a given month.^Pronounced/\u02ccw\u026ak\u026a\u02c8pi\u02d0di\u0259/\u24d8WIK-ih-PEE-dee-\u0259or/\u02ccw\u026aki-/\u24d8WIK-ee-PEE-dee-\u0259^Now available as an archive at theNostalgia Wikipedia^Revisions with libelous content, criminal threats, or copyright infringements may be removed completely.^The committee may directly rule that a content change is inappropriate, but may not directly rule that certain content is inappropriate.^See\"Libel\"by David McHam for the legal distinctionReferences^abSidener, Jonathan (December 6, 2004).\"Everyone's Encyclopedia\".U-T San Diego.

Archived fromthe originalon November 1, 2021. RetrievedMarch 26,2021.There is a certain mindset associated with unmoderated Usenet groups [...] that infects the collectively-managed Wikipedia project: if you react strongly to trolling, that reflects poorly on you, not (necessarily) on the troll. If you [...] demand that something be done about constant disruption by trollish behavior, the other listmembers will cry \"censorship\", attack you, and even come to the defense of the troll. [...] The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem [...] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise are tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts.
