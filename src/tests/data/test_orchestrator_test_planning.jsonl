Specifically, focus on algorithms that have been successfully used for similar tasks in the past and have proven accuracy and reliability.\\n\\nRelevant Paper Title and Summary:\\nTitle: Tropical cyclone intensity estimations over the Indian ocean using\\n  Machine Learning\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclones are one of the most powerful and destructive natural\\nphenomena on earth. Tropical storms and heavy rains can cause floods, which\\nlead to human lives and economic loss. Devastating winds accompanying cyclones\\nheavily affect not only the coastal regions, even distant areas. Our study\\nfocuses on the intensity estimation, particularly cyclone grade and maximum\\nsustained surface wind speed (MSWS) of a tropical cyclone over the North Indian\\nOcean. We use various machine learning algorithms to estimate cyclone grade and\\nMSWS. We have used the basin of origin, date, time, latitude, longitude,\\nestimated central pressure, and pressure drop as attributes of our models. We\\nuse multi-class classification models for the categorical outcome variable,\\ncyclone grade, and regression models for MSWS as it is a continuous variable.\\nUsing the best track data of 28 years over the North Indian Ocean, we estimate\\ngrade with an accuracy of 88% and MSWS with a root mean square error (RMSE) of\\n2.3. For higher grade categories (5-7), accuracy improves to an average of\\n98.84%. We tested our model with two recent tropical cyclones in the North\\nIndian Ocean, Vayu and Fani. For grade, we obtained an accuracy of 93.22% and\\n95.23% respectively, while for MSWS, we obtained RMSE of 2.2 and 3.4 and $R^2$\\nof 0.99 and 0.99, respectively.\\n Title: TCR-GAN: Predicting tropical cyclone passive microwave rainfall using\\n  infrared imagery via generative adversarial networks\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclones (TC) generally carry large amounts of water vapor and can\\ncause large-scale extreme rainfall. Passive microwave rainfall (PMR) estimation\\nof TC with high spatial and temporal resolution is crucial for disaster warning\\nof TC, but remains a challenging problem due to the low temporal resolution of\\nmicrowave sensors. This study attempts to solve this problem by directly\\nforecasting PMR from satellite infrared (IR) images of TC. We develop a\\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) to convert IR images into PMR, and\\nestablish the mapping relationship between TC cloud-top bright temperature and\\nPMR, the algorithm is named TCR-GAN. Meanwhile, a new dataset that is available\\nas a benchmark, Dataset of Tropical Cyclone IR-to-Rainfall Prediction (TCIRRP)\\nwas established, which is expected to advance the development of artificial\\nintelligence in this direction. Experimental results show that the algorithm\\ncan effectively extract key features from IR. The end-to-end deep learning\\napproach shows potential as a technique that can be applied globally and\\nprovides a new perspective tropical cyclone precipitation prediction via\\nsatellite, which is expected to provide important insights for real-time\\nvisualization of TC rainfall globally in operations.\\n Title: WRF model parameter calibration to improve the prediction of tropical\\n  cyclones over the Bay of Bengal using Machine Learning-based Multiobjective\\n  Optimization\\nSummary:   The prediction skill of a numerical model can be enhanced by calibrating the\\nsensitive parameters that significantly influence the model forecast. The\\nobjective of the present study is to improve the prediction of surface wind\\nspeed and precipitation by calibrating the Weather Research and Forecasting\\n(WRF) model parameters for the simulations of tropical cyclones over the Bay of\\nBengal region. Ten tropical cyclones across different intensity categories\\nbetween 2011 and 2017 are selected for the calibration experiments. Eight\\nsensitive model parameters are calibrated by minimizing the prediction error\\ncorresponding to 10m wind speed and precipitation, using a multiobjective\\nadaptive surrogate model-based optimization (MO-ASMO) framework. The 10m wind\\nspeed and precipitation simulated by the default and calibrated parameter\\nvalues across different aspects are compared. The results show that the\\ncalibrated parameters improved the prediction of 10m wind speed by 17.62% and\\nprecipitation by 8.20% compared to the default parameters. The effect of\\ncalibrated parameters on other model output variables, such as cyclone track\\nand intensities, and 500 hPa wind fields, is investigated. Eight tropical\\ncyclones across different categories between 2011 and 2018 are selected to\\ncorroborate the performance of the calibrated parameter values for other\\ncyclone events. Finally, the robustness of the calibrated parameters across\\ndifferent boundary conditions and grid resolutions is also examined. These\\nresults will have significant implications for improving the predictability of\\ntropical cyclone characteristics. This allows us to better plan the adaptation\\nand mitigation strategies and thus help in preventing the adverse effects on\\nsociety.\\n Title: Intensity Prediction of Tropical Cyclones using Long Short-Term Memory\\n  Network\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclones can be of varied intensity and cause a huge loss of lives\\nand property if the intensity is high enough. Therefore, the prediction of the\\nintensity of tropical cyclones advance in time is of utmost importance. We\\npropose a novel stacked bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM)\\nbased model architecture to predict the intensity of a tropical cyclone in\\nterms of Maximum surface sustained wind speed (MSWS). The proposed model can\\npredict MSWS well advance in time (up to 72 h) with very high accuracy. We have\\napplied the model on tropical cyclones in the North Indian Ocean from 1982 to\\n2018 and checked its performance on two recent tropical cyclones, namely, Fani\\nand Vayu. The model predicts MSWS (in knots) for the next 3, 12, 24, 36, 48,\\n60, and 72 hours with a mean absolute error of 1.52, 3.66, 5.88, 7.42, 8.96,\\n10.15, and 11.92, respectively.\\n Title: Prediction of Landfall Intensity, Location, and Time of a Tropical\\n  Cyclone\\nSummary:   The prediction of the intensity, location and time of the landfall of a\\ntropical cyclone well advance in time and with high accuracy can reduce human\\nand material loss immensely. In this article, we develop a Long Short-Term\\nmemory based Recurrent Neural network model to predict intensity (in terms of\\nmaximum sustained surface wind speed), location (latitude and longitude), and\\ntime (in hours after the observation period) of the landfall of a tropical\\ncyclone which originates in the North Indian ocean. The model takes as input\\nthe best track data of cyclone consisting of its location, pressure, sea\\nsurface temperature, and intensity for certain hours (from 12 to 36 hours)\\nanytime during the course of the cyclone as a time series and then provide\\npredictions with high accuracy. For example, using 24 hours data of a cyclone\\nanytime during its course, the model provides state-of-the-art results by\\npredicting landfall intensity, time, latitude, and longitude with a mean\\nabsolute error of 4.24 knots, 4.5 hours, 0.24 degree, and 0.37 degree\\nrespectively, which resulted in a distance error of 51.7 kilometers from the\\nlandfall location. We further check the efficacy of the model on three recent\\ndevastating cyclones Bulbul, Fani, and Gaja, and achieved better results than\\nthe test dataset.\\n Title: Tackling the Overestimation of Forest Carbon with Deep Learning and\\n  Aerial Imagery\\nSummary:   Forest carbon offsets are increasingly popular and can play a significant\\nrole in financing climate mitigation, forest conservation, and reforestation.\\nMeasuring how much carbon is stored in forests is, however, still largely done\\nvia expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes unaccountable field measurements.\\nTo overcome these limitations, many verification bodies are leveraging machine\\nlearning (ML) algorithms to estimate forest carbon from satellite or aerial\\nimagery. Aerial imagery allows for tree species or family classification, which\\nimproves the satellite imagery-based forest type classification. However,\\naerial imagery is significantly more expensive to collect and it is unclear by\\nhow much the higher resolution improves the forest carbon estimation. This\\nproposal paper describes the first systematic comparison of forest carbon\\nestimation from aerial imagery, satellite imagery, and ground-truth field\\nmeasurements via deep learning-based algorithms for a tropical reforestation\\nproject. Our initial results show that forest carbon estimates from satellite\\nimagery can overestimate above-ground biomass by up to 10-times for tropical\\nreforestation projects. The significant difference between aerial and\\nsatellite-derived forest carbon measurements shows the potential for aerial\\nimagery-based ML algorithms and raises the importance to extend this study to a\\nglobal benchmark between options for carbon measurements.\\n Title: Stacked transfer learning for tropical cyclone intensity prediction\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclone wind-intensity prediction is a challenging task considering\\ndrastic changes climate patterns over the last few decades. In order to develop\\nrobust prediction models, one needs to consider different characteristics of\\ncyclones in terms of spatial and temporal characteristics. Transfer learning\\nincorporates knowledge from a related source dataset to compliment a target\\ndatasets especially in cases where there is lack or data. Stacking is a form of\\nensemble learning focused for improving generalization that has been recently\\nused for transfer learning problems which is referred to as transfer stacking.\\nIn this paper, we employ transfer stacking as a means of studying the effects\\nof cyclones whereby we evaluate if cyclones in different geographic locations\\ncan be helpful for improving generalization performs. Moreover, we use\\nconventional neural networks for evaluating the effects of duration on cyclones\\nin prediction performance. Therefore, we develop an effective strategy that\\nevaluates the relationships between different types of cyclones through\\ntransfer learning and conventional learning methods via neural networks.\\n Title: Identifying Distributional Differences in Convective Evolution Prior to\\n  Rapid Intensification in Tropical Cyclones\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclone (TC) intensity forecasts are issued by human forecasters who\\nevaluate spatio-temporal observations (e.g., satellite imagery) and model\\noutput (e.g., numerical weather prediction, statistical models) to produce\\nforecasts every 6 hours. Within these time constraints, it can be challenging\\nto draw insight from such data. While high-capacity machine learning methods\\nare well suited for prediction problems with complex sequence data, extracting\\ninterpretable scientific information with such methods is difficult. Here we\\nleverage powerful AI prediction algorithms and classical statistical inference\\nto identify patterns in the evolution of TC convective structure leading up to\\nthe rapid intensification of a storm, hence providing forecasters and\\nscientists with key insight into TC behavior.\\n Title: Attention-Based Scattering Network for Satellite Imagery\\nSummary:   Multi-channel satellite imagery, from stacked spectral bands or\\nspatiotemporal data, have meaningful representations for various atmospheric\\nproperties. Combining these features in an effective manner to create a\\nperformant and trustworthy model is of utmost importance to forecasters. Neural\\nnetworks show promise, yet suffer from unintuitive computations, fusion of\\nhigh-level features, and may be limited by the quantity of available data. In\\nthis work, we leverage the scattering transform to extract high-level features\\nwithout additional trainable parameters and introduce a separation scheme to\\nbring attention to independent input channels. Experiments show promising\\nresults on estimating tropical cyclone intensity and predicting the occurrence\\nof lightning from satellite imagery.\\n Title: Detecting Distributional Differences in Labeled Sequence Data with\\n  Application to Tropical Cyclone Satellite Imagery\\nSummary:   Our goal is to quantify whether, and if so how, spatio-temporal patterns in\\ntropical cyclone (TC) satellite imagery signal an upcoming rapid intensity\\nchange event. To address this question, we propose a new nonparametric test of\\nassociation between a time series of images and a series of binary event\\nlabels. We ask whether there is a difference in distribution between (dependent\\nbut identically distributed) 24-h sequences of images preceding an event versus\\na non-event. By rewriting the statistical test as a regression problem, we\\nleverage neural networks to infer modes of structural evolution of TC\\nconvection that are representative of the lead-up to rapid intensity change\\nevents. Dependencies between nearby sequences are handled by a bootstrap\\nprocedure that estimates the marginal distribution of the label series. We\\nprove that type I error control is guaranteed as long as the distribution of\\nthe label series is well-estimated, which is made easier by the extensive\\nhistorical data for binary TC event labels. We show empirical evidence that our\\nproposed method identifies archetypes of infrared imagery associated with\\nelevated rapid intensification risk, typically marked by deep or deepening core\\nconvection over time. Such results provide a foundation for improved forecasts\\nof rapid intensification.\\n\\n\\n\\nReview and analyze the provided paper summary with respect to the task.

Specifically, focus on algorithms that have been successfully used for similar tasks in the past and have proven accuracy and reliability.\\n\\nRelevant Paper Title and Summary:\\nTitle: Tropical cyclone intensity estimations over the Indian ocean using\\n  Machine Learning\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclones are one of the most powerful and destructive natural\\nphenomena on earth. Tropical storms and heavy rains can cause floods, which\\nlead to human lives and economic loss. Devastating winds accompanying cyclones\\nheavily affect not only the coastal regions, even distant areas. Our study\\nfocuses on the intensity estimation, particularly cyclone grade and maximum\\nsustained surface wind speed (MSWS) of a tropical cyclone over the North Indian\\nOcean. We use various machine learning algorithms to estimate cyclone grade and\\nMSWS. We have used the basin of origin, date, time, latitude, longitude,\\nestimated central pressure, and pressure drop as attributes of our models. We\\nuse multi-class classification models for the categorical outcome variable,\\ncyclone grade, and regression models for MSWS as it is a continuous variable.\\nUsing the best track data of 28 years over the North Indian Ocean, we estimate\\ngrade with an accuracy of 88% and MSWS with a root mean square error (RMSE) of\\n2.3. For higher grade categories (5-7), accuracy improves to an average of\\n98.84%. We tested our model with two recent tropical cyclones in the North\\nIndian Ocean, Vayu and Fani. For grade, we obtained an accuracy of 93.22% and\\n95.23% respectively, while for MSWS, we obtained RMSE of 2.2 and 3.4 and $R^2$\\nof 0.99 and 0.99, respectively.\\n Title: WRF model parameter calibration to improve the prediction of tropical\\n  cyclones over the Bay of Bengal using Machine Learning-based Multiobjective\\n  Optimization\\nSummary:   The prediction skill of a numerical model can be enhanced by calibrating the\\nsensitive parameters that significantly influence the model forecast. The\\nobjective of the present study is to improve the prediction of surface wind\\nspeed and precipitation by calibrating the Weather Research and Forecasting\\n(WRF) model parameters for the simulations of tropical cyclones over the Bay of\\nBengal region. Ten tropical cyclones across different intensity categories\\nbetween 2011 and 2017 are selected for the calibration experiments. Eight\\nsensitive model parameters are calibrated by minimizing the prediction error\\ncorresponding to 10m wind speed and precipitation, using a multiobjective\\nadaptive surrogate model-based optimization (MO-ASMO) framework. The 10m wind\\nspeed and precipitation simulated by the default and calibrated parameter\\nvalues across different aspects are compared. The results show that the\\ncalibrated parameters improved the prediction of 10m wind speed by 17.62% and\\nprecipitation by 8.20% compared to the default parameters. The effect of\\ncalibrated parameters on other model output variables, such as cyclone track\\nand intensities, and 500 hPa wind fields, is investigated. Eight tropical\\ncyclones across different categories between 2011 and 2018 are selected to\\ncorroborate the performance of the calibrated parameter values for other\\ncyclone events. Finally, the robustness of the calibrated parameters across\\ndifferent boundary conditions and grid resolutions is also examined. These\\nresults will have significant implications for improving the predictability of\\ntropical cyclone characteristics. This allows us to better plan the adaptation\\nand mitigation strategies and thus help in preventing the adverse effects on\\nsociety.\\n Title: Intensity Prediction of Tropical Cyclones using Long Short-Term Memory\\n  Network\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclones can be of varied intensity and cause a huge loss of lives\\nand property if the intensity is high enough. Therefore, the prediction of the\\nintensity of tropical cyclones advance in time is of utmost importance. We\\npropose a novel stacked bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM)\\nbased model architecture to predict the intensity of a tropical cyclone in\\nterms of Maximum surface sustained wind speed (MSWS). The proposed model can\\npredict MSWS well advance in time (up to 72 h) with very high accuracy. We have\\napplied the model on tropical cyclones in the North Indian Ocean from 1982 to\\n2018 and checked its performance on two recent tropical cyclones, namely, Fani\\nand Vayu. The model predicts MSWS (in knots) for the next 3, 12, 24, 36, 48,\\n60, and 72 hours with a mean absolute error of 1.52, 3.66, 5.88, 7.42, 8.96,\\n10.15, and 11.92, respectively.\\n Title: Prediction of Landfall Intensity, Location, and Time of a Tropical\\n  Cyclone\\nSummary:   The prediction of the intensity, location and time of the landfall of a\\ntropical cyclone well advance in time and with high accuracy can reduce human\\nand material loss immensely. In this article, we develop a Long Short-Term\\nmemory based Recurrent Neural network model to predict intensity (in terms of\\nmaximum sustained surface wind speed), location (latitude and longitude), and\\ntime (in hours after the observation period) of the landfall of a tropical\\ncyclone which originates in the North Indian ocean. The model takes as input\\nthe best track data of cyclone consisting of its location, pressure, sea\\nsurface temperature, and intensity for certain hours (from 12 to 36 hours)\\nanytime during the course of the cyclone as a time series and then provide\\npredictions with high accuracy. For example, using 24 hours data of a cyclone\\nanytime during its course, the model provides state-of-the-art results by\\npredicting landfall intensity, time, latitude, and longitude with a mean\\nabsolute error of 4.24 knots, 4.5 hours, 0.24 degree, and 0.37 degree\\nrespectively, which resulted in a distance error of 51.7 kilometers from the\\nlandfall location. We further check the efficacy of the model on three recent\\ndevastating cyclones Bulbul, Fani, and Gaja, and achieved better results than\\nthe test dataset.\\n Title: TCR-GAN: Predicting tropical cyclone passive microwave rainfall using\\n  infrared imagery via generative adversarial networks\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclones (TC) generally carry large amounts of water vapor and can\\ncause large-scale extreme rainfall. Passive microwave rainfall (PMR) estimation\\nof TC with high spatial and temporal resolution is crucial for disaster warning\\nof TC, but remains a challenging problem due to the low temporal resolution of\\nmicrowave sensors. This study attempts to solve this problem by directly\\nforecasting PMR from satellite infrared (IR) images of TC. We develop a\\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) to convert IR images into PMR, and\\nestablish the mapping relationship between TC cloud-top bright temperature and\\nPMR, the algorithm is named TCR-GAN. Meanwhile, a new dataset that is available\\nas a benchmark, Dataset of Tropical Cyclone IR-to-Rainfall Prediction (TCIRRP)\\nwas established, which is expected to advance the development of artificial\\nintelligence in this direction. Experimental results show that the algorithm\\ncan effectively extract key features from IR. The end-to-end deep learning\\napproach shows potential as a technique that can be applied globally and\\nprovides a new perspective tropical cyclone precipitation prediction via\\nsatellite, which is expected to provide important insights for real-time\\nvisualization of TC rainfall globally in operations.\\n Title: Stacked transfer learning for tropical cyclone intensity prediction\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclone wind-intensity prediction is a challenging task considering\\ndrastic changes climate patterns over the last few decades. In order to develop\\nrobust prediction models, one needs to consider different characteristics of\\ncyclones in terms of spatial and temporal characteristics. Transfer learning\\nincorporates knowledge from a related source dataset to compliment a target\\ndatasets especially in cases where there is lack or data. Stacking is a form of\\nensemble learning focused for improving generalization that has been recently\\nused for transfer learning problems which is referred to as transfer stacking.\\nIn this paper, we employ transfer stacking as a means of studying the effects\\nof cyclones whereby we evaluate if cyclones in different geographic locations\\ncan be helpful for improving generalization performs. Moreover, we use\\nconventional neural networks for evaluating the effects of duration on cyclones\\nin prediction performance. Therefore, we develop an effective strategy that\\nevaluates the relationships between different types of cyclones through\\ntransfer learning and conventional learning methods via neural networks.\\n Title: Tropical Cyclone Track Forecasting using Fused Deep Learning from\\n  Aligned Reanalysis Data\\nSummary:   The forecast of tropical cyclone trajectories is crucial for the protection\\nof people and property. Although forecast dynamical models can provide\\nhigh-precision short-term forecasts, they are computationally demanding, and\\ncurrent statistical forecasting models have much room for improvement given\\nthat the database of past hurricanes is constantly growing. Machine learning\\nmethods, that can capture non-linearities and complex relations, have only been\\nscarcely tested for this application. We propose a neural network model fusing\\npast trajectory data and reanalysis atmospheric images (wind and pressure 3D\\nfields). We use a moving frame of reference that follows the storm center for\\nthe 24h tracking forecast. The network is trained to estimate the longitude and\\nlatitude displacement of tropical cyclones and depressions from a large\\ndatabase from both hemispheres (more than 3000 storms since 1979, sampled at a\\n6 hour frequency). The advantage of the fused network is demonstrated and a\\ncomparison with current forecast models shows that deep learning methods could\\nprovide a valuable and complementary prediction. Moreover, our method can give\\na forecast for a new storm in a few seconds, which is an important asset for\\nreal-time forecasts compared to traditional forecasts.\\n Title: Impacts of different cumulus physics over south Asia region with case\\n  study tropical cyclone Viyaru\\nSummary:   Tropical Cyclone Viyaru, formerly known as Cyclonic Storm Mahasen was a\\nrapidly intensifying, category 01B storm that made landfall in Chittagong,\\nBangladesh on the 16th of May, 2013. In this study, the sensitivity of\\nnumerical simulations of tropical cyclone to cumulus physics parametrization is\\ncarried out with a view to determine the best cumulus physics option for\\nprediction of the cyclones track, timing, and central pressure evolution in the\\nBay of Bengal. For this purpose, the tropical cyclone Viyaru has been simulated\\nby WRF ARW in a nested domain with NCEP Global Final Analysis(FNL) data as\\ninitial and boundary conditions. The model domain consists of one parent domain\\nand one nested domain. The resolution of the parent domain is 36 km while the\\nnested domain has a resolution of 12 km. Five numerical simulations have been\\ndone with the same micro-physics scheme (WSM3), planetary boundary layer\\nscheme,NOAH land surface scheme but different Cumulus Parametrization scheme.\\nFour cumulus Parametrization schemes are KF, BMJ, GF and Tiedtke and one\\nsimulation was done without any cumulus physics scheme. The results of model\\nsimulations are compared with corresponding analysis or observation data. For\\nbest result data provided by Joint Typhoon Warning Center and NASA tropical\\ncyclone center was used as observed for comparison. After the study it was\\nfound that tracks, intensity, wind speed, precipitation, and central pressure\\nof the cyclone have sensitive result with different cumulus physics schemes.\\n Title: Determining the sensitive parameters of WRF model for the prediction of\\n  Tropical cyclones in Bay of Bengal using Global sensitivity analysis and\\n  Machine learning\\nSummary:   The present study focuses on identifying the parameters from the Weather\\nResearch and Forecasting (WRF) model that strongly influence the prediction of\\ntropical cyclones over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) region. Three global sensitivity\\nanalysis (SA) methods namely the Morris One-at-A-Time (MOAT), Multivariate\\nAdaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and surrogate-based Sobol' are employed to\\nidentify the most sensitive parameters out of 24 tunable parameters\\ncorresponding to seven parameterization schemes of the WRF model. Ten tropical\\ncyclones across different categories, such as cyclonic storms, severe cyclonic\\nstorms, and very severe cyclonic storms over BoB between 2011 and 2018, are\\nselected in this study. The sensitivity scores of 24 parameters are evaluated\\nfor eight meteorological variables. The parameter sensitivity results are\\nconsistent across three SA methods for all the variables, and 8 out of the 24\\nparameters contribute 80%-90% to the overall sensitivity scores. It is found\\nthat the Sobol' method with Gaussian progress regression as a surrogate model\\ncan produce reliable sensitivity results when the available samples exceed 200.\\nThe parameters with which the model simulations have the least RMSE values when\\ncompared with the observations are considered as the optimal parameters.\\nComparing observations and model simulations with the default and optimal\\nparameters shows that predictions with the optimal set of parameters yield a\\n19.65% improvement in surface wind, 6.5% in surface temperature, and 13.2% in\\nprecipitation predictions, compared to the default set of parameters.\\n Title: Wind and Wave Extremes over the World Oceans from Very Large Ensembles\\nSummary:   Global return values of marine wind speed and significant wave height are\\nestimated from very large aggregates of archived ensemble forecasts at +240-h\\nlead time. Long lead time ensures that the forecasts represent independent\\ndraws from the model climate. Compared with ERA-Interim, a reanalysis, the\\nensemble yields higher return estimates for both wind speed and significant\\nwave height. Confidence intervals are much tighter due to the large size of the\\ndataset. The period (9 yrs) is short enough to be considered stationary even\\nwith climate change. Furthermore, the ensemble is large enough for\\nnon-parametric 100-yr return estimates to be made from order statistics. These\\ndirect return estimates compare well with extreme value estimates outside areas\\nwith tropical cyclones. Like any method employing modeled fields, it is\\nsensitive to tail biases in the numerical model, but we find that the biases\\nare moderate outside areas with tropical cyclones.\\n\\n\\n\\nReview and analyze the provided paper summary with respect to the task. Craft a concise and short, unified summary that distills key information that is most relevant to the task, incorporating reference links within the summary.\\nOnly use the information given.

For higher grade categories (5-7), accuracy improves to an average of\\n98.84%. We tested our model with two recent tropical cyclones in the North\\nIndian Ocean, Vayu and Fani. For grade, we obtained an accuracy of 93.22% and\\n95.23% respectively, while for MSWS, we obtained RMSE of 2.2 and 3.4 and $R^2$\\nof 0.99 and 0.99, respectively.\\n Title: WRF model parameter calibration to improve the prediction of tropical\\n  cyclones over the Bay of Bengal using Machine Learning-based Multiobjective\\n  Optimization\\nSummary:   The prediction skill of a numerical model can be enhanced by calibrating the\\nsensitive parameters that significantly influence the model forecast. The\\nobjective of the present study is to improve the prediction of surface wind\\nspeed and precipitation by calibrating the Weather Research and Forecasting\\n(WRF) model parameters for the simulations of tropical cyclones over the Bay of\\nBengal region. Ten tropical cyclones across different intensity categories\\nbetween 2011 and 2017 are selected for the calibration experiments. Eight\\nsensitive model parameters are calibrated by minimizing the prediction error\\ncorresponding to 10m wind speed and precipitation, using a multiobjective\\nadaptive surrogate model-based optimization (MO-ASMO) framework. The 10m wind\\nspeed and precipitation simulated by the default and calibrated parameter\\nvalues across different aspects are compared. The results show that the\\ncalibrated parameters improved the prediction of 10m wind speed by 17.62% and\\nprecipitation by 8.20% compared to the default parameters. The effect of\\ncalibrated parameters on other model output variables, such as cyclone track\\nand intensities, and 500 hPa wind fields, is investigated. Eight tropical\\ncyclones across different categories between 2011 and 2018 are selected to\\ncorroborate the performance of the calibrated parameter values for other\\ncyclone events. Finally, the robustness of the calibrated parameters across\\ndifferent boundary conditions and grid resolutions is also examined. These\\nresults will have significant implications for improving the predictability of\\ntropical cyclone characteristics. This allows us to better plan the adaptation\\nand mitigation strategies and thus help in preventing the adverse effects on\\nsociety.\\n Title: Intensity Prediction of Tropical Cyclones using Long Short-Term Memory\\n  Network\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclones can be of varied intensity and cause a huge loss of lives\\nand property if the intensity is high enough. Therefore, the prediction of the\\nintensity of tropical cyclones advance in time is of utmost importance. We\\npropose a novel stacked bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM)\\nbased model architecture to predict the intensity of a tropical cyclone in\\nterms of Maximum surface sustained wind speed (MSWS). The proposed model can\\npredict MSWS well advance in time (up to 72 h) with very high accuracy. We have\\napplied the model on tropical cyclones in the North Indian Ocean from 1982 to\\n2018 and checked its performance on two recent tropical cyclones, namely, Fani\\nand Vayu. The model predicts MSWS (in knots) for the next 3, 12, 24, 36, 48,\\n60, and 72 hours with a mean absolute error of 1.52, 3.66, 5.88, 7.42, 8.96,\\n10.15, and 11.92, respectively.\\n Title: Prediction of Landfall Intensity, Location, and Time of a Tropical\\n  Cyclone\\nSummary:   The prediction of the intensity, location and time of the landfall of a\\ntropical cyclone well advance in time and with high accuracy can reduce human\\nand material loss immensely. In this article, we develop a Long Short-Term\\nmemory based Recurrent Neural network model to predict intensity (in terms of\\nmaximum sustained surface wind speed), location (latitude and longitude), and\\ntime (in hours after the observation period) of the landfall of a tropical\\ncyclone which originates in the North Indian ocean. The model takes as input\\nthe best track data of cyclone consisting of its location, pressure, sea\\nsurface temperature, and intensity for certain hours (from 12 to 36 hours)\\nanytime during the course of the cyclone as a time series and then provide\\npredictions with high accuracy. For example, using 24 hours data of a cyclone\\nanytime during its course, the model provides state-of-the-art results by\\npredicting landfall intensity, time, latitude, and longitude with a mean\\nabsolute error of 4.24 knots, 4.5 hours, 0.24 degree, and 0.37 degree\\nrespectively, which resulted in a distance error of 51.7 kilometers from the\\nlandfall location. We further check the efficacy of the model on three recent\\ndevastating cyclones Bulbul, Fani, and Gaja, and achieved better results than\\nthe test dataset.\\n Title: TCR-GAN: Predicting tropical cyclone passive microwave rainfall using\\n  infrared imagery via generative adversarial networks\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclones (TC) generally carry large amounts of water vapor and can\\ncause large-scale extreme rainfall. Passive microwave rainfall (PMR) estimation\\nof TC with high spatial and temporal resolution is crucial for disaster warning\\nof TC, but remains a challenging problem due to the low temporal resolution of\\nmicrowave sensors. This study attempts to solve this problem by directly\\nforecasting PMR from satellite infrared (IR) images of TC. We develop a\\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) to convert IR images into PMR, and\\nestablish the mapping relationship between TC cloud-top bright temperature and\\nPMR, the algorithm is named TCR-GAN. Meanwhile, a new dataset that is available\\nas a benchmark, Dataset of Tropical Cyclone IR-to-Rainfall Prediction (TCIRRP)\\nwas established, which is expected to advance the development of artificial\\nintelligence in this direction. Experimental results show that the algorithm\\ncan effectively extract key features from IR. The end-to-end deep learning\\napproach shows potential as a technique that can be applied globally and\\nprovides a new perspective tropical cyclone precipitation prediction via\\nsatellite, which is expected to provide important insights for real-time\\nvisualization of TC rainfall globally in operations.\\n Title: Stacked transfer learning for tropical cyclone intensity prediction\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclone wind-intensity prediction is a challenging task considering\\ndrastic changes climate patterns over the last few decades. In order to develop\\nrobust prediction models, one needs to consider different characteristics of\\ncyclones in terms of spatial and temporal characteristics. Transfer learning\\nincorporates knowledge from a related source dataset to compliment a target\\ndatasets especially in cases where there is lack or data. Stacking is a form of\\nensemble learning focused for improving generalization that has been recently\\nused for transfer learning problems which is referred to as transfer stacking.\\nIn this paper, we employ transfer stacking as a means of studying the effects\\nof cyclones whereby we evaluate if cyclones in different geographic locations\\ncan be helpful for improving generalization performs. Moreover, we use\\nconventional neural networks for evaluating the effects of duration on cyclones\\nin prediction performance. Therefore, we develop an effective strategy that\\nevaluates the relationships between different types of cyclones through\\ntransfer learning and conventional learning methods via neural networks.\\n Title: Tropical Cyclone Track Forecasting using Fused Deep Learning from\\n  Aligned Reanalysis Data\\nSummary:   The forecast of tropical cyclone trajectories is crucial for the protection\\nof people and property. Although forecast dynamical models can provide\\nhigh-precision short-term forecasts, they are computationally demanding, and\\ncurrent statistical forecasting models have much room for improvement given\\nthat the database of past hurricanes is constantly growing. Machine learning\\nmethods, that can capture non-linearities and complex relations, have only been\\nscarcely tested for this application. We propose a neural network model fusing\\npast trajectory data and reanalysis atmospheric images (wind and pressure 3D\\nfields). We use a moving frame of reference that follows the storm center for\\nthe 24h tracking forecast. The network is trained to estimate the longitude and\\nlatitude displacement of tropical cyclones and depressions from a large\\ndatabase from both hemispheres (more than 3000 storms since 1979, sampled at a\\n6 hour frequency). The advantage of the fused network is demonstrated and a\\ncomparison with current forecast models shows that deep learning methods could\\nprovide a valuable and complementary prediction. Moreover, our method can give\\na forecast for a new storm in a few seconds, which is an important asset for\\nreal-time forecasts compared to traditional forecasts.\\n Title: Impacts of different cumulus physics over south Asia region with case\\n  study tropical cyclone Viyaru\\nSummary:   Tropical Cyclone Viyaru, formerly known as Cyclonic Storm Mahasen was a\\nrapidly intensifying, category 01B storm that made landfall in Chittagong,\\nBangladesh on the 16th of May, 2013. In this study, the sensitivity of\\nnumerical simulations of tropical cyclone to cumulus physics parametrization is\\ncarried out with a view to determine the best cumulus physics option for\\nprediction of the cyclones track, timing, and central pressure evolution in the\\nBay of Bengal. For this purpose, the tropical cyclone Viyaru has been simulated\\nby WRF ARW in a nested domain with NCEP Global Final Analysis(FNL) data as\\ninitial and boundary conditions. The model domain consists of one parent domain\\nand one nested domain. The resolution of the parent domain is 36 km while the\\nnested domain has a resolution of 12 km. Five numerical simulations have been\\ndone with the same micro-physics scheme (WSM3), planetary boundary layer\\nscheme,NOAH land surface scheme but different Cumulus Parametrization scheme.\\nFour cumulus Parametrization schemes are KF, BMJ, GF and Tiedtke and one\\nsimulation was done without any cumulus physics scheme. The results of model\\nsimulations are compared with corresponding analysis or observation data. For\\nbest result data provided by Joint Typhoon Warning Center and NASA tropical\\ncyclone center was used as observed for comparison. After the study it was\\nfound that tracks, intensity, wind speed, precipitation, and central pressure\\nof the cyclone have sensitive result with different cumulus physics schemes.\\n Title: Determining the sensitive parameters of WRF model for the prediction of\\n  Tropical cyclones in Bay of Bengal using Global sensitivity analysis and\\n  Machine learning\\nSummary:   The present study focuses on identifying the parameters from the Weather\\nResearch and Forecasting (WRF) model that strongly influence the prediction of\\ntropical cyclones over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) region. Three global sensitivity\\nanalysis (SA) methods namely the Morris One-at-A-Time (MOAT), Multivariate\\nAdaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and surrogate-based Sobol' are employed to\\nidentify the most sensitive parameters out of 24 tunable parameters\\ncorresponding to seven parameterization schemes of the WRF model. Ten tropical\\ncyclones across different categories, such as cyclonic storms, severe cyclonic\\nstorms, and very severe cyclonic storms over BoB between 2011 and 2018, are\\nselected in this study. The sensitivity scores of 24 parameters are evaluated\\nfor eight meteorological variables. The parameter sensitivity results are\\nconsistent across three SA methods for all the variables, and 8 out of the 24\\nparameters contribute 80%-90% to the overall sensitivity scores. It is found\\nthat the Sobol' method with Gaussian progress regression as a surrogate model\\ncan produce reliable sensitivity results when the available samples exceed 200.\\nThe parameters with which the model simulations have the least RMSE values when\\ncompared with the observations are considered as the optimal parameters.\\nComparing observations and model simulations with the default and optimal\\nparameters shows that predictions with the optimal set of parameters yield a\\n19.65% improvement in surface wind, 6.5% in surface temperature, and 13.2% in\\nprecipitation predictions, compared to the default set of parameters.\\n Title: Wind and Wave Extremes over the World Oceans from Very Large Ensembles\\nSummary:   Global return values of marine wind speed and significant wave height are\\nestimated from very large aggregates of archived ensemble forecasts at +240-h\\nlead time. Long lead time ensures that the forecasts represent independent\\ndraws from the model climate. Compared with ERA-Interim, a reanalysis, the\\nensemble yields higher return estimates for both wind speed and significant\\nwave height. Confidence intervals are much tighter due to the large size of the\\ndataset. The period (9 yrs) is short enough to be considered stationary even\\nwith climate change. Furthermore, the ensemble is large enough for\\nnon-parametric 100-yr return estimates to be made from order statistics. These\\ndirect return estimates compare well with extreme value estimates outside areas\\nwith tropical cyclones. Like any method employing modeled fields, it is\\nsensitive to tail biases in the numerical model, but we find that the biases\\nare moderate outside areas with tropical cyclones.\\n\\n\\n\\nReview and analyze the provided paper summary with respect to the task. Craft a concise and short, unified summary that distills key information that is most relevant to the task, incorporating reference links within the summary.\\nOnly use the information given.

Specifically, focus on algorithms that have been successfully used for similar tasks in the past and have proven accuracy and reliability.\\n\\nRelevant Paper Title and Summary:\\nTitle: Tropical cyclone intensity estimations over the Indian ocean using\\n  Machine Learning\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclones are one of the most powerful and destructive natural\\nphenomena on earth. Tropical storms and heavy rains can cause floods, which\\nlead to human lives and economic loss. Devastating winds accompanying cyclones\\nheavily affect not only the coastal regions, even distant areas. Our study\\nfocuses on the intensity estimation, particularly cyclone grade and maximum\\nsustained surface wind speed (MSWS) of a tropical cyclone over the North Indian\\nOcean. We use various machine learning algorithms to estimate cyclone grade and\\nMSWS. We have used the basin of origin, date, time, latitude, longitude,\\nestimated central pressure, and pressure drop as attributes of our models. We\\nuse multi-class classification models for the categorical outcome variable,\\ncyclone grade, and regression models for MSWS as it is a continuous variable.\\nUsing the best track data of 28 years over the North Indian Ocean, we estimate\\ngrade with an accuracy of 88% and MSWS with a root mean square error (RMSE) of\\n2.3. For higher grade categories (5-7), accuracy improves to an average of\\n98.84%. We tested our model with two recent tropical cyclones in the North\\nIndian Ocean, Vayu and Fani. For grade, we obtained an accuracy of 93.22% and\\n95.23% respectively, while for MSWS, we obtained RMSE of 2.2 and 3.4 and $R^2$\\nof 0.99 and 0.99, respectively.\\n Title: WRF model parameter calibration to improve the prediction of tropical\\n  cyclones over the Bay of Bengal using Machine Learning-based Multiobjective\\n  Optimization\\nSummary:   The prediction skill of a numerical model can be enhanced by calibrating the\\nsensitive parameters that significantly influence the model forecast. The\\nobjective of the present study is to improve the prediction of surface wind\\nspeed and precipitation by calibrating the Weather Research and Forecasting\\n(WRF) model parameters for the simulations of tropical cyclones over the Bay of\\nBengal region. Ten tropical cyclones across different intensity categories\\nbetween 2011 and 2017 are selected for the calibration experiments. Eight\\nsensitive model parameters are calibrated by minimizing the prediction error\\ncorresponding to 10m wind speed and precipitation, using a multiobjective\\nadaptive surrogate model-based optimization (MO-ASMO) framework. The 10m wind\\nspeed and precipitation simulated by the default and calibrated parameter\\nvalues across different aspects are compared. The results show that the\\ncalibrated parameters improved the prediction of 10m wind speed by 17.62% and\\nprecipitation by 8.20% compared to the default parameters. The effect of\\ncalibrated parameters on other model output variables, such as cyclone track\\nand intensities, and 500 hPa wind fields, is investigated. Eight tropical\\ncyclones across different categories between 2011 and 2018 are selected to\\ncorroborate the performance of the calibrated parameter values for other\\ncyclone events. Finally, the robustness of the calibrated parameters across\\ndifferent boundary conditions and grid resolutions is also examined. These\\nresults will have significant implications for improving the predictability of\\ntropical cyclone characteristics. This allows us to better plan the adaptation\\nand mitigation strategies and thus help in preventing the adverse effects on\\nsociety.\\n Title: Intensity Prediction of Tropical Cyclones using Long Short-Term Memory\\n  Network\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclones can be of varied intensity and cause a huge loss of lives\\nand property if the intensity is high enough. Therefore, the prediction of the\\nintensity of tropical cyclones advance in time is of utmost importance. We\\npropose a novel stacked bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM)\\nbased model architecture to predict the intensity of a tropical cyclone in\\nterms of Maximum surface sustained wind speed (MSWS). The proposed model can\\npredict MSWS well advance in time (up to 72 h) with very high accuracy. We have\\napplied the model on tropical cyclones in the North Indian Ocean from 1982 to\\n2018 and checked its performance on two recent tropical cyclones, namely, Fani\\nand Vayu. The model predicts MSWS (in knots) for the next 3, 12, 24, 36, 48,\\n60, and 72 hours with a mean absolute error of 1.52, 3.66, 5.88, 7.42, 8.96,\\n10.15, and 11.92, respectively.\\n Title: Prediction of Landfall Intensity, Location, and Time of a Tropical\\n  Cyclone\\nSummary:   The prediction of the intensity, location and time of the landfall of a\\ntropical cyclone well advance in time and with high accuracy can reduce human\\nand material loss immensely. In this article, we develop a Long Short-Term\\nmemory based Recurrent Neural network model to predict intensity (in terms of\\nmaximum sustained surface wind speed), location (latitude and longitude), and\\ntime (in hours after the observation period) of the landfall of a tropical\\ncyclone which originates in the North Indian ocean. The model takes as input\\nthe best track data of cyclone consisting of its location, pressure, sea\\nsurface temperature, and intensity for certain hours (from 12 to 36 hours)\\nanytime during the course of the cyclone as a time series and then provide\\npredictions with high accuracy. For example, using 24 hours data of a cyclone\\nanytime during its course, the model provides state-of-the-art results by\\npredicting landfall intensity, time, latitude, and longitude with a mean\\nabsolute error of 4.24 knots, 4.5 hours, 0.24 degree, and 0.37 degree\\nrespectively, which resulted in a distance error of 51.7 kilometers from the\\nlandfall location. We further check the efficacy of the model on three recent\\ndevastating cyclones Bulbul, Fani, and Gaja, and achieved better results than\\nthe test dataset.\\n Title: TCR-GAN: Predicting tropical cyclone passive microwave rainfall using\\n  infrared imagery via generative adversarial networks\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclones (TC) generally carry large amounts of water vapor and can\\ncause large-scale extreme rainfall. Passive microwave rainfall (PMR) estimation\\nof TC with high spatial and temporal resolution is crucial for disaster warning\\nof TC, but remains a challenging problem due to the low temporal resolution of\\nmicrowave sensors. This study attempts to solve this problem by directly\\nforecasting PMR from satellite infrared (IR) images of TC. We develop a\\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) to convert IR images into PMR, and\\nestablish the mapping relationship between TC cloud-top bright temperature and\\nPMR, the algorithm is named TCR-GAN. Meanwhile, a new dataset that is available\\nas a benchmark, Dataset of Tropical Cyclone IR-to-Rainfall Prediction (TCIRRP)\\nwas established, which is expected to advance the development of artificial\\nintelligence in this direction. Experimental results show that the algorithm\\ncan effectively extract key features from IR.

In order to develop\\nrobust prediction models, one needs to consider different characteristics of\\ncyclones in terms of spatial and temporal characteristics. Transfer learning\\nincorporates knowledge from a related source dataset to compliment a target\\ndatasets especially in cases where there is lack or data. Stacking is a form of\\nensemble learning focused for improving generalization that has been recently\\nused for transfer learning problems which is referred to as transfer stacking.\\nIn this paper, we employ transfer stacking as a means of studying the effects\\nof cyclones whereby we evaluate if cyclones in different geographic locations\\ncan be helpful for improving generalization performs. Moreover, we use\\nconventional neural networks for evaluating the effects of duration on cyclones\\nin prediction performance. Therefore, we develop an effective strategy that\\nevaluates the relationships between different types of cyclones through\\ntransfer learning and conventional learning methods via neural networks.\\n Title: Tropical Cyclone Track Forecasting using Fused Deep Learning from\\n  Aligned Reanalysis Data\\nSummary:   The forecast of tropical cyclone trajectories is crucial for the protection\\nof people and property. Although forecast dynamical models can provide\\nhigh-precision short-term forecasts, they are computationally demanding, and\\ncurrent statistical forecasting models have much room for improvement given\\nthat the database of past hurricanes is constantly growing. Machine learning\\nmethods, that can capture non-linearities and complex relations, have only been\\nscarcely tested for this application. We propose a neural network model fusing\\npast trajectory data and reanalysis atmospheric images (wind and pressure 3D\\nfields). We use a moving frame of reference that follows the storm center for\\nthe 24h tracking forecast. The network is trained to estimate the longitude and\\nlatitude displacement of tropical cyclones and depressions from a large\\ndatabase from both hemispheres (more than 3000 storms since 1979, sampled at a\\n6 hour frequency). The advantage of the fused network is demonstrated and a\\ncomparison with current forecast models shows that deep learning methods could\\nprovide a valuable and complementary prediction. Moreover, our method can give\\na forecast for a new storm in a few seconds, which is an important asset for\\nreal-time forecasts compared to traditional forecasts.\\n Title: Impacts of different cumulus physics over south Asia region with case\\n  study tropical cyclone Viyaru\\nSummary:   Tropical Cyclone Viyaru, formerly known as Cyclonic Storm Mahasen was a\\nrapidly intensifying, category 01B storm that made landfall in Chittagong,\\nBangladesh on the 16th of May, 2013. In this study, the sensitivity of\\nnumerical simulations of tropical cyclone to cumulus physics parametrization is\\ncarried out with a view to determine the best cumulus physics option for\\nprediction of the cyclones track, timing, and central pressure evolution in the\\nBay of Bengal. For this purpose, the tropical cyclone Viyaru has been simulated\\nby WRF ARW in a nested domain with NCEP Global Final Analysis(FNL) data as\\ninitial and boundary conditions. The model domain consists of one parent domain\\nand one nested domain. The resolution of the parent domain is 36 km while the\\nnested domain has a resolution of 12 km. Five numerical simulations have been\\ndone with the same micro-physics scheme (WSM3), planetary boundary layer\\nscheme,NOAH land surface scheme but different Cumulus Parametrization scheme.\\nFour cumulus Parametrization schemes are KF, BMJ, GF and Tiedtke and one\\nsimulation was done without any cumulus physics scheme. The results of model\\nsimulations are compared with corresponding analysis or observation data. For\\nbest result data provided by Joint Typhoon Warning Center and NASA tropical\\ncyclone center was used as observed for comparison. After the study it was\\nfound that tracks, intensity, wind speed, precipitation, and central pressure\\nof the cyclone have sensitive result with different cumulus physics schemes.\\n Title: Determining the sensitive parameters of WRF model for the prediction of\\n  Tropical cyclones in Bay of Bengal using Global sensitivity analysis and\\n  Machine learning\\nSummary:   The present study focuses on identifying the parameters from the Weather\\nResearch and Forecasting (WRF) model that strongly influence the prediction of\\ntropical cyclones over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) region. Three global sensitivity\\nanalysis (SA) methods namely the Morris One-at-A-Time (MOAT), Multivariate\\nAdaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and surrogate-based Sobol' are employed to\\nidentify the most sensitive parameters out of 24 tunable parameters\\ncorresponding to seven parameterization schemes of the WRF model. Ten tropical\\ncyclones across different categories, such as cyclonic storms, severe cyclonic\\nstorms, and very severe cyclonic storms over BoB between 2011 and 2018, are\\nselected in this study. The sensitivity scores of 24 parameters are evaluated\\nfor eight meteorological variables. The parameter sensitivity results are\\nconsistent across three SA methods for all the variables, and 8 out of the 24\\nparameters contribute 80%-90% to the overall sensitivity scores. It is found\\nthat the Sobol' method with Gaussian progress regression as a surrogate model\\ncan produce reliable sensitivity results when the available samples exceed 200.\\nThe parameters with which the model simulations have the least RMSE values when\\ncompared with the observations are considered as the optimal parameters.\\nComparing observations and model simulations with the default and optimal\\nparameters shows that predictions with the optimal set of parameters yield a\\n19.65% improvement in surface wind, 6.5% in surface temperature, and 13.2% in\\nprecipitation predictions, compared to the default set of parameters.\\n Title: Wind and Wave Extremes over the World Oceans from Very Large Ensembles\\nSummary:   Global return values of marine wind speed and significant wave height are\\nestimated from very large aggregates of archived ensemble forecasts at +240-h\\nlead time. Long lead time ensures that the forecasts represent independent\\ndraws from the model climate. Compared with ERA-Interim, a reanalysis, the\\nensemble yields higher return estimates for both wind speed and significant\\nwave height. Confidence intervals are much tighter due to the large size of the\\ndataset. The period (9 yrs) is short enough to be considered stationary even\\nwith climate change. Furthermore, the ensemble is large enough for\\nnon-parametric 100-yr return estimates to be made from order statistics. These\\ndirect return estimates compare well with extreme value estimates outside areas\\nwith tropical cyclones. Like any method employing modeled fields, it is\\nsensitive to tail biases in the numerical model, but we find that the biases\\nare moderate outside areas with tropical cyclones.\\n\\n\\n\\nReview and analyze the provided paper summary with respect to the task.

Tropical storms and heavy rains can cause floods, which\\nlead to human lives and economic loss. Devastating winds accompanying cyclones\\nheavily affect not only the coastal regions, even distant areas. Our study\\nfocuses on the intensity estimation, particularly cyclone grade and maximum\\nsustained surface wind speed (MSWS) of a tropical cyclone over the North Indian\\nOcean. We use various machine learning algorithms to estimate cyclone grade and\\nMSWS. We have used the basin of origin, date, time, latitude, longitude,\\nestimated central pressure, and pressure drop as attributes of our models. We\\nuse multi-class classification models for the categorical outcome variable,\\ncyclone grade, and regression models for MSWS as it is a continuous variable.\\nUsing the best track data of 28 years over the North Indian Ocean, we estimate\\ngrade with an accuracy of 88% and MSWS with a root mean square error (RMSE) of\\n2.3. For higher grade categories (5-7), accuracy improves to an average of\\n98.84%. We tested our model with two recent tropical cyclones in the North\\nIndian Ocean, Vayu and Fani. For grade, we obtained an accuracy of 93.22% and\\n95.23% respectively, while for MSWS, we obtained RMSE of 2.2 and 3.4 and $R^2$\\nof 0.99 and 0.99, respectively.\\n Title: WRF model parameter calibration to improve the prediction of tropical\\n  cyclones over the Bay of Bengal using Machine Learning-based Multiobjective\\n  Optimization\\nSummary:   The prediction skill of a numerical model can be enhanced by calibrating the\\nsensitive parameters that significantly influence the model forecast. The\\nobjective of the present study is to improve the prediction of surface wind\\nspeed and precipitation by calibrating the Weather Research and Forecasting\\n(WRF) model parameters for the simulations of tropical cyclones over the Bay of\\nBengal region. Ten tropical cyclones across different intensity categories\\nbetween 2011 and 2017 are selected for the calibration experiments. Eight\\nsensitive model parameters are calibrated by minimizing the prediction error\\ncorresponding to 10m wind speed and precipitation, using a multiobjective\\nadaptive surrogate model-based optimization (MO-ASMO) framework. The 10m wind\\nspeed and precipitation simulated by the default and calibrated parameter\\nvalues across different aspects are compared. The results show that the\\ncalibrated parameters improved the prediction of 10m wind speed by 17.62% and\\nprecipitation by 8.20% compared to the default parameters. The effect of\\ncalibrated parameters on other model output variables, such as cyclone track\\nand intensities, and 500 hPa wind fields, is investigated. Eight tropical\\ncyclones across different categories between 2011 and 2018 are selected to\\ncorroborate the performance of the calibrated parameter values for other\\ncyclone events. Finally, the robustness of the calibrated parameters across\\ndifferent boundary conditions and grid resolutions is also examined. These\\nresults will have significant implications for improving the predictability of\\ntropical cyclone characteristics. This allows us to better plan the adaptation\\nand mitigation strategies and thus help in preventing the adverse effects on\\nsociety.\\n Title: Intensity Prediction of Tropical Cyclones using Long Short-Term Memory\\n  Network\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclones can be of varied intensity and cause a huge loss of lives\\nand property if the intensity is high enough. Therefore, the prediction of the\\nintensity of tropical cyclones advance in time is of utmost importance. We\\npropose a novel stacked bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM)\\nbased model architecture to predict the intensity of a tropical cyclone in\\nterms of Maximum surface sustained wind speed (MSWS). The proposed model can\\npredict MSWS well advance in time (up to 72 h) with very high accuracy. We have\\napplied the model on tropical cyclones in the North Indian Ocean from 1982 to\\n2018 and checked its performance on two recent tropical cyclones, namely, Fani\\nand Vayu. The model predicts MSWS (in knots) for the next 3, 12, 24, 36, 48,\\n60, and 72 hours with a mean absolute error of 1.52, 3.66, 5.88, 7.42, 8.96,\\n10.15, and 11.92, respectively.\\n Title: Prediction of Landfall Intensity, Location, and Time of a Tropical\\n  Cyclone\\nSummary:   The prediction of the intensity, location and time of the landfall of a\\ntropical cyclone well advance in time and with high accuracy can reduce human\\nand material loss immensely. In this article, we develop a Long Short-Term\\nmemory based Recurrent Neural network model to predict intensity (in terms of\\nmaximum sustained surface wind speed), location (latitude and longitude), and\\ntime (in hours after the observation period) of the landfall of a tropical\\ncyclone which originates in the North Indian ocean. The model takes as input\\nthe best track data of cyclone consisting of its location, pressure, sea\\nsurface temperature, and intensity for certain hours (from 12 to 36 hours)\\nanytime during the course of the cyclone as a time series and then provide\\npredictions with high accuracy. For example, using 24 hours data of a cyclone\\nanytime during its course, the model provides state-of-the-art results by\\npredicting landfall intensity, time, latitude, and longitude with a mean\\nabsolute error of 4.24 knots, 4.5 hours, 0.24 degree, and 0.37 degree\\nrespectively, which resulted in a distance error of 51.7 kilometers from the\\nlandfall location. We further check the efficacy of the model on three recent\\ndevastating cyclones Bulbul, Fani, and Gaja, and achieved better results than\\nthe test dataset.\\n Title: TCR-GAN: Predicting tropical cyclone passive microwave rainfall using\\n  infrared imagery via generative adversarial networks\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclones (TC) generally carry large amounts of water vapor and can\\ncause large-scale extreme rainfall. Passive microwave rainfall (PMR) estimation\\nof TC with high spatial and temporal resolution is crucial for disaster warning\\nof TC, but remains a challenging problem due to the low temporal resolution of\\nmicrowave sensors. This study attempts to solve this problem by directly\\nforecasting PMR from satellite infrared (IR) images of TC. We develop a\\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) to convert IR images into PMR, and\\nestablish the mapping relationship between TC cloud-top bright temperature and\\nPMR, the algorithm is named TCR-GAN. Meanwhile, a new dataset that is available\\nas a benchmark, Dataset of Tropical Cyclone IR-to-Rainfall Prediction (TCIRRP)\\nwas established, which is expected to advance the development of artificial\\nintelligence in this direction. Experimental results show that the algorithm\\ncan effectively extract key features from IR.

For higher grade categories (5-7), accuracy improves to an average of\\n98.84%. We tested our model with two recent tropical cyclones in the North\\nIndian Ocean, Vayu and Fani. For grade, we obtained an accuracy of 93.22% and\\n95.23% respectively, while for MSWS, we obtained RMSE of 2.2 and 3.4 and $R^2$\\nof 0.99 and 0.99, respectively.\\n Title: WRF model parameter calibration to improve the prediction of tropical\\n  cyclones over the Bay of Bengal using Machine Learning-based Multiobjective\\n  Optimization\\nSummary:   The prediction skill of a numerical model can be enhanced by calibrating the\\nsensitive parameters that significantly influence the model forecast. The\\nobjective of the present study is to improve the prediction of surface wind\\nspeed and precipitation by calibrating the Weather Research and Forecasting\\n(WRF) model parameters for the simulations of tropical cyclones over the Bay of\\nBengal region. Ten tropical cyclones across different intensity categories\\nbetween 2011 and 2017 are selected for the calibration experiments. Eight\\nsensitive model parameters are calibrated by minimizing the prediction error\\ncorresponding to 10m wind speed and precipitation, using a multiobjective\\nadaptive surrogate model-based optimization (MO-ASMO) framework. The 10m wind\\nspeed and precipitation simulated by the default and calibrated parameter\\nvalues across different aspects are compared. The results show that the\\ncalibrated parameters improved the prediction of 10m wind speed by 17.62% and\\nprecipitation by 8.20% compared to the default parameters. The effect of\\ncalibrated parameters on other model output variables, such as cyclone track\\nand intensities, and 500 hPa wind fields, is investigated. Eight tropical\\ncyclones across different categories between 2011 and 2018 are selected to\\ncorroborate the performance of the calibrated parameter values for other\\ncyclone events. Finally, the robustness of the calibrated parameters across\\ndifferent boundary conditions and grid resolutions is also examined. These\\nresults will have significant implications for improving the predictability of\\ntropical cyclone characteristics. This allows us to better plan the adaptation\\nand mitigation strategies and thus help in preventing the adverse effects on\\nsociety.\\n Title: Intensity Prediction of Tropical Cyclones using Long Short-Term Memory\\n  Network\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclones can be of varied intensity and cause a huge loss of lives\\nand property if the intensity is high enough. Therefore, the prediction of the\\nintensity of tropical cyclones advance in time is of utmost importance. We\\npropose a novel stacked bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM)\\nbased model architecture to predict the intensity of a tropical cyclone in\\nterms of Maximum surface sustained wind speed (MSWS). The proposed model can\\npredict MSWS well advance in time (up to 72 h) with very high accuracy. We have\\napplied the model on tropical cyclones in the North Indian Ocean from 1982 to\\n2018 and checked its performance on two recent tropical cyclones, namely, Fani\\nand Vayu. The model predicts MSWS (in knots) for the next 3, 12, 24, 36, 48,\\n60, and 72 hours with a mean absolute error of 1.52, 3.66, 5.88, 7.42, 8.96,\\n10.15, and 11.92, respectively.\\n Title: Prediction of Landfall Intensity, Location, and Time of a Tropical\\n  Cyclone\\nSummary:   The prediction of the intensity, location and time of the landfall of a\\ntropical cyclone well advance in time and with high accuracy can reduce human\\nand material loss immensely. In this article, we develop a Long Short-Term\\nmemory based Recurrent Neural network model to predict intensity (in terms of\\nmaximum sustained surface wind speed), location (latitude and longitude), and\\ntime (in hours after the observation period) of the landfall of a tropical\\ncyclone which originates in the North Indian ocean. The model takes as input\\nthe best track data of cyclone consisting of its location, pressure, sea\\nsurface temperature, and intensity for certain hours (from 12 to 36 hours)\\nanytime during the course of the cyclone as a time series and then provide\\npredictions with high accuracy. For example, using 24 hours data of a cyclone\\nanytime during its course, the model provides state-of-the-art results by\\npredicting landfall intensity, time, latitude, and longitude with a mean\\nabsolute error of 4.24 knots, 4.5 hours, 0.24 degree, and 0.37 degree\\nrespectively, which resulted in a distance error of 51.7 kilometers from the\\nlandfall location. We further check the efficacy of the model on three recent\\ndevastating cyclones Bulbul, Fani, and Gaja, and achieved better results than\\nthe test dataset.\\n Title: TCR-GAN: Predicting tropical cyclone passive microwave rainfall using\\n  infrared imagery via generative adversarial networks\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclones (TC) generally carry large amounts of water vapor and can\\ncause large-scale extreme rainfall. Passive microwave rainfall (PMR) estimation\\nof TC with high spatial and temporal resolution is crucial for disaster warning\\nof TC, but remains a challenging problem due to the low temporal resolution of\\nmicrowave sensors. This study attempts to solve this problem by directly\\nforecasting PMR from satellite infrared (IR) images of TC. We develop a\\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) to convert IR images into PMR, and\\nestablish the mapping relationship between TC cloud-top bright temperature and\\nPMR, the algorithm is named TCR-GAN. Meanwhile, a new dataset that is available\\nas a benchmark, Dataset of Tropical Cyclone IR-to-Rainfall Prediction (TCIRRP)\\nwas established, which is expected to advance the development of artificial\\nintelligence in this direction. Experimental results show that the algorithm\\ncan effectively extract key features from IR. The end-to-end deep learning\\napproach shows potential as a technique that can be applied globally and\\nprovides a new perspective tropical cyclone precipitation prediction via\\nsatellite, which is expected to provide important insights for real-time\\nvisualization of TC rainfall globally in operations.\\n Title: Stacked transfer learning for tropical cyclone intensity prediction\\nSummary:   Tropical cyclone wind-intensity prediction is a challenging task considering\\ndrastic changes climate patterns over the last few decades. In order to develop\\nrobust prediction models, one needs to consider different characteristics of\\ncyclones in terms of spatial and temporal characteristics. Transfer learning\\nincorporates knowledge from a related source dataset to compliment a target\\ndatasets especially in cases where there is lack or data. Stacking is a form of\\nensemble learning focused for improving generalization that has been recently\\nused for transfer learning problems which is referred to as transfer stacking.\\nIn this paper, we employ transfer stacking as a means of studying the effects\\nof cyclones whereby we evaluate if cyclones in different geographic locations\\ncan be helpful for improving generalization performs. Moreover, we use\\nconventional neural networks for evaluating the effects of duration on cyclones\\nin prediction performance. Therefore, we develop an effective strategy that\\nevaluates the relationships between different types of cyclones through\\ntransfer learning and conventional learning methods via neural networks.\\n Title: Tropical Cyclone Track Forecasting using Fused Deep Learning from\\n  Aligned Reanalysis Data\\nSummary:   The forecast of tropical cyclone trajectories is crucial for the protection\\nof people and property. Although forecast dynamical models can provide\\nhigh-precision short-term forecasts, they are computationally demanding, and\\ncurrent statistical forecasting models have much room for improvement given\\nthat the database of past hurricanes is constantly growing. Machine learning\\nmethods, that can capture non-linearities and complex relations, have only been\\nscarcely tested for this application. We propose a neural network model fusing\\npast trajectory data and reanalysis atmospheric images (wind and pressure 3D\\nfields). We use a moving frame of reference that follows the storm center for\\nthe 24h tracking forecast. The network is trained to estimate the longitude and\\nlatitude displacement of tropical cyclones and depressions from a large\\ndatabase from both hemispheres (more than 3000 storms since 1979, sampled at a\\n6 hour frequency). The advantage of the fused network is demonstrated and a\\ncomparison with current forecast models shows that deep learning methods could\\nprovide a valuable and complementary prediction. Moreover, our method can give\\na forecast for a new storm in a few seconds, which is an important asset for\\nreal-time forecasts compared to traditional forecasts.\\n Title: Impacts of different cumulus physics over south Asia region with case\\n  study tropical cyclone Viyaru\\nSummary:   Tropical Cyclone Viyaru, formerly known as Cyclonic Storm Mahasen was a\\nrapidly intensifying, category 01B storm that made landfall in Chittagong,\\nBangladesh on the 16th of May, 2013. In this study, the sensitivity of\\nnumerical simulations of tropical cyclone to cumulus physics parametrization is\\ncarried out with a view to determine the best cumulus physics option for\\nprediction of the cyclones track, timing, and central pressure evolution in the\\nBay of Bengal. For this purpose, the tropical cyclone Viyaru has been simulated\\nby WRF ARW in a nested domain with NCEP Global Final Analysis(FNL) data as\\ninitial and boundary conditions. The model domain consists of one parent domain\\nand one nested domain. The resolution of the parent domain is 36 km while the\\nnested domain has a resolution of 12 km. Five numerical simulations have been\\ndone with the same micro-physics scheme (WSM3), planetary boundary layer\\nscheme,NOAH land surface scheme but different Cumulus Parametrization scheme.\\nFour cumulus Parametrization schemes are KF, BMJ, GF and Tiedtke and one\\nsimulation was done without any cumulus physics scheme. The results of model\\nsimulations are compared with corresponding analysis or observation data. For\\nbest result data provided by Joint Typhoon Warning Center and NASA tropical\\ncyclone center was used as observed for comparison. After the study it was\\nfound that tracks, intensity, wind speed, precipitation, and central pressure\\nof the cyclone have sensitive result with different cumulus physics schemes.\\n Title: Determining the sensitive parameters of WRF model for the prediction of\\n  Tropical cyclones in Bay of Bengal using Global sensitivity analysis and\\n  Machine learning\\nSummary:   The present study focuses on identifying the parameters from the Weather\\nResearch and Forecasting (WRF) model that strongly influence the prediction of\\ntropical cyclones over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) region. Three global sensitivity\\nanalysis (SA) methods namely the Morris One-at-A-Time (MOAT), Multivariate\\nAdaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and surrogate-based Sobol' are employed to\\nidentify the most sensitive parameters out of 24 tunable parameters\\ncorresponding to seven parameterization schemes of the WRF model. Ten tropical\\ncyclones across different categories, such as cyclonic storms, severe cyclonic\\nstorms, and very severe cyclonic storms over BoB between 2011 and 2018, are\\nselected in this study. The sensitivity scores of 24 parameters are evaluated\\nfor eight meteorological variables. The parameter sensitivity results are\\nconsistent across three SA methods for all the variables, and 8 out of the 24\\nparameters contribute 80%-90% to the overall sensitivity scores. It is found\\nthat the Sobol' method with Gaussian progress regression as a surrogate model\\ncan produce reliable sensitivity results when the available samples exceed 200.\\nThe parameters with which the model simulations have the least RMSE values when\\ncompared with the observations are considered as the optimal parameters.\\nComparing observations and model simulations with the default and optimal\\nparameters shows that predictions with the optimal set of parameters yield a\\n19.65% improvement in surface wind, 6.5% in surface temperature, and 13.2% in\\nprecipitation predictions, compared to the default set of parameters.\\n Title: Wind and Wave Extremes over the World Oceans from Very Large Ensembles\\nSummary:   Global return values of marine wind speed and significant wave height are\\nestimated from very large aggregates of archived ensemble forecasts at +240-h\\nlead time. Long lead time ensures that the forecasts represent independent\\ndraws from the model climate. Compared with ERA-Interim, a reanalysis, the\\nensemble yields higher return estimates for both wind speed and significant\\nwave height. Confidence intervals are much tighter due to the large size of the\\ndataset. The period (9 yrs) is short enough to be considered stationary even\\nwith climate change. Furthermore, the ensemble is large enough for\\nnon-parametric 100-yr return estimates to be made from order statistics. These\\ndirect return estimates compare well with extreme value estimates outside areas\\nwith tropical cyclones. Like any method employing modeled fields, it is\\nsensitive to tail biases in the numerical model, but we find that the biases\\nare moderate outside areas with tropical cyclones.\\n\\n\\n\\nReview and analyze the provided paper summary with respect to the task.

Gather insights and guidance on how to incorporate physics-based models into the analysis. Discuss the potential benefits of integrating physics-based models with machine learning algorithms for more accurate estimation.\\nIn order to understand the underlying physics principles and equations that govern the relationship between satellite imagery features and wind speed of tropical cyclones, it is important to consider the physical processes that influence wind speed and identify relevant variables and parameters.\\n\\nOne key physical principle that governs the relationship between satellite imagery features and wind speed is the conservation of angular momentum. Tropical cyclones are rotating systems, and their wind speeds are influenced by the conservation of angular momentum as the cyclone intensifies or weakens. The angular momentum of a cyclone is determined by the rotation rate and the distribution of mass within the cyclone.\\n\\nSatellite imagery features, such as cloud patterns and cloud-top temperatures, can provide valuable information about the structure and dynamics of tropical cyclones. By analyzing these features, it is possible to infer the distribution of mass within the cyclone and estimate the wind speed.\\n\\nIncorporating physics-based models into the analysis can provide additional insights and improve the accuracy of wind speed estimation. These models can be used to simulate the physical processes that govern the behavior of tropical cyclones and provide a framework for interpreting the satellite imagery data.\\n\\nFor example, numerical weather prediction models, which solve the equations of motion and thermodynamics, can be used to simulate the evolution of tropical cyclones and generate synthetic satellite imagery. By comparing the synthetic imagery with the actual satellite imagery, it is possible to validate the accuracy of the wind speed estimates obtained from the machine learning algorithms.\\n\\nIntegrating physics-based models with machine learning algorithms can also help in addressing some of the limitations of purely data-driven approaches. Physics-based models can provide physical constraints and regularization to the machine learning algorithms, improving their generalization and reducing the risk of overfitting. Additionally, physics-based models can help in interpreting the results obtained from the machine learning algorithms and provide a physical basis for the estimated wind speeds.\\n\\nBy collaborating with the physicist, the team can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying physics principles and equations that govern the relationship between satellite imagery features and wind speed of tropical cyclones. This understanding can guide the selection and development of machine learning algorithms and help in incorporating physics-based models into the analysis. The integration of physics-based models with machine learning algorithms can lead to more accurate estimation of wind speed and provide valuable insights into the dynamics of tropical cyclones.\\n\\n[1] \"Tropical cyclone intensity estimations over the Indian ocean using Machine Learning\" - [Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334014607_Tropical_cyclone_intensity_estimations_over_the_Indian_ocean_using_Machine_Learning)\\n\\n[2] \"Intensity Prediction of Tropical Cyclones using Long Short-Term Memory Network\" - [Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334014607_Tropical_cyclone_intensity_estimations_over_the_Indian_ocean_using_Machine_Learning)\\nWork with the ML Engineer to develop and train a machine learning model using the identified algorithms and the satellite imagery data.

By comparing the synthetic imagery with the actual satellite imagery, it is possible to validate the accuracy of the wind speed estimates obtained from the machine learning algorithms.\\n\\nIntegrating physics-based models with machine learning algorithms can also help in addressing some of the limitations of purely data-driven approaches. Physics-based models can provide physical constraints and regularization to the machine learning algorithms, improving their generalization and reducing the risk of overfitting. Additionally, physics-based models can help in interpreting the results obtained from the machine learning algorithms and provide a physical basis for the estimated wind speeds.\\n\\nBy collaborating with the physicist, the team can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying physics principles and equations that govern the relationship between satellite imagery features and wind speed of tropical cyclones. This understanding can guide the selection and development of machine learning algorithms and help in incorporating physics-based models into the analysis. The integration of physics-based models with machine learning algorithms can lead to more accurate estimation of wind speed and provide valuable insights into the dynamics of tropical cyclones.\\n\\n[1] \"Tropical cyclone intensity estimations over the Indian ocean using Machine Learning\" - [Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334014607_Tropical_cyclone_intensity_estimations_over_the_Indian_ocean_using_Machine_Learning)\\n\\n[2] \"Intensity Prediction of Tropical Cyclones using Long Short-Term Memory Network\" - [Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334014607_Tropical_cyclone_intensity_estimations_over_the_Indian_ocean_using_Machine_Learning)\\nWork with the ML Engineer to develop and train a machine learning model using the identified algorithms and the satellite imagery data.
