Yet\\nreal-world autonomous tests face several unique safety challenges, both due to\\nthe possibility of causing harm during a test, as well as the risk of\\nencountering new unsafe agent behavior through interactions with real-world and\\npotentially malicious actors. We propose a framework for conducting safe\\nautonomous agent tests on the open internet: agent actions are audited by a\\ncontext-sensitive monitor that enforces a stringent safety boundary to stop an\\nunsafe test, with suspect behavior ranked and logged to be examined by humans.\\nWe design a basic safety monitor (AgentMonitor) that is flexible enough to\\nmonitor existing LLM agents, and, using an adversarial simulated agent, we\\nmeasure its ability to identify and stop unsafe situations. Then we apply the\\nAgentMonitor on a battery of real-world tests of AutoGPT, and we identify\\nseveral limitations and challenges that will face the creation of safe\\nin-the-wild tests as autonomous agents grow more capable.\\n Title: REX: Rapid Exploration and eXploitation for AI Agents\\nSummary:   In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach for Rapid Exploration and\\neXploitation for AI Agents called REX. Existing AutoGPT-style techniques have\\ninherent limitations, such as a heavy reliance on precise descriptions for\\ndecision-making, and the lack of a systematic approach to leverage try-and-fail\\nprocedures akin to traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL). REX introduces an\\nadditional layer of rewards and integrates concepts similar to Upper Confidence\\nBound (UCB) scores, leading to more robust and efficient AI agent performance.\\nThis approach has the advantage of enabling the utilization of offline\\nbehaviors from logs and allowing seamless integration with existing foundation\\nmodels while it does not require any model fine-tuning. Through comparative\\nanalysis with existing methods such as Chain-of-Thoughts(CoT) and Reasoning viA\\nPlanning(RAP), REX-based methods demonstrate comparable performance and, in\\ncertain cases, even surpass the results achieved by these existing techniques.\\nNotably, REX-based methods exhibit remarkable reductions in execution time,\\nenhancing their practical applicability across a diverse set of scenarios.\\n Title: GeoGPT: Understanding and Processing Geospatial Tasks through An\\n  Autonomous GPT\\nSummary:   Decision-makers in GIS need to combine a series of spatial algorithms and\\noperations to solve geospatial tasks. For example, in the task of facility\\nsiting, the Buffer tool is usually first used to locate areas close or away\\nfrom some specific entities; then, the Intersect or Erase tool is used to\\nselect candidate areas satisfied multiple requirements. Though professionals\\ncan easily understand and solve these geospatial tasks by sequentially\\nutilizing relevant tools, it is difficult for non-professionals to handle these\\nproblems. Recently, Generative Pre-trained Transformer (e.g., ChatGPT) presents\\nstrong performance in semantic understanding and reasoning. Especially, AutoGPT\\ncan further extend the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by\\nautomatically reasoning and calling externally defined tools. Inspired by these\\nstudies, we attempt to lower the threshold of non-professional users to solve\\ngeospatial tasks by integrating the semantic understanding ability inherent in\\nLLMs with mature tools within the GIS community. Specifically, we develop a new\\nframework called GeoGPT that can conduct geospatial data collection,\\nprocessing, and analysis in an autonomous manner with the instruction of only\\nnatural language. In other words, GeoGPT is used to understand the demands of\\nnon-professional users merely based on input natural language descriptions, and\\nthen think, plan, and execute defined GIS tools to output final effective\\nresults. Several cases including geospatial data crawling, spatial query,\\nfacility siting, and mapping validate the effectiveness of our framework.\\nThough limited cases are presented in this paper, GeoGPT can be further\\nextended to various tasks by equipping with more GIS tools, and we think the\\nparadigm of \"foundational plus professional\" implied in GeoGPT provides an\\neffective way to develop next-generation GIS in this era of large foundation\\nmodels.\\n Title: MetaTool Benchmark for Large Language Models: Deciding Whether to Use\\n  Tools and Which to Use\\nSummary:   Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their\\nimpressive natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. Recently, many\\nstudies have focused on the tool utilization ability of LLMs. They primarily\\ninvestigated how LLMs effectively collaborate with given specific tools.\\nHowever, in scenarios where LLMs serve as intelligent agents, as seen in\\napplications like AutoGPT and MetaGPT, LLMs are expected to engage in intricate\\ndecision-making processes that involve deciding whether to employ a tool and\\nselecting the most suitable tool(s) from a collection of available tools to\\nfulfill user requests. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce MetaTool, a\\nbenchmark designed to evaluate whether LLMs have tool usage awareness and can\\ncorrectly choose tools. Specifically, we create a dataset called ToolE within\\nthe benchmark. This dataset contains various types of user queries in the form\\nof prompts that trigger LLMs to use tools, including both single-tool and\\nmulti-tool scenarios. Subsequently, we set the tasks for both tool usage\\nawareness and tool selection. We define four subtasks from different\\nperspectives in tool selection, including tool selection with similar choices,\\ntool selection in specific scenarios, tool selection with possible reliability\\nissues, and multi-tool selection. We conduct experiments involving eight\\npopular LLMs and find that the majority of them still struggle to effectively\\nselect tools, highlighting the existing gaps between LLMs and genuine\\nintelligent agents. However, through the error analysis, we found there is\\nstill significant room for improvement. Finally, we conclude with insights for\\ntool developers -- we strongly recommend that tool developers choose an\\nappropriate rewrite model for generating new descriptions based on the\\ndownstream LLM the tool will apply to.
