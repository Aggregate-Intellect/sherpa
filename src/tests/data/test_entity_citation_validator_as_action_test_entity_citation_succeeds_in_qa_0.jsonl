This is different from the standard twelve months in the Gregorian calendar used in the USA. The Ethiopian calendar consists of twelve months with 30 days each and a thirteenth month called Pagum\u0113, which has either five or six days depending on whether it is a leap year. This difference in the number of months is one of the distinctive features of the Ethiopian calendar.\\n\\nFor more information, you can refer to the Ethiopian Calendar Association (ECA) and the World Calendar Association (WCA) for details on the unique characteristics of the Ethiopian calendar.", "llm_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo"}
